That’s why the Trump Administration will rebuild our military and do everything it can to make sure our veterans get the care they deserve. Our military needs every asset at its disposal to defend America. We cannot allow other nations to surpass our military capability. The Trump Administration will pursue the highest level of military readiness. President Trump will end the defense sequester and submit a new budget to Congress outlining a plan to rebuild our military. We will provide our military leaders with the means to plan for our future defense needs. We will also develop a state-of-the-art missile defense system to protect against missile-based attacks from states like Iran and North Korea. Cyberwarfare is an emerging battlefield, and we must take every measure to safeguard our national security secrets and systems. We will make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans to serve in this crucial area. Let us never forget that our military is comprised of heroic people. We must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families – both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life. We will get our veterans the care they need wherever and whenever they need it. There should be no more long drives. No more wait lists or scheduling backlogs. No more excessive red tape. Just the care and support our veterans have earned through sacrifice and service to our country. The Trump Administration will transform the Department of Veterans Affairs to meet the needs of 21st century service members and of our female veterans. Our reforms will begin with firing the corrupt and incompetent VA executives who let our veterans down, modernizing the bureaucracy, and empowering the doctors and nurses to ensure our veterans receive the best care available in a timely manner. Under the Trump Administration, America will meet its commitments to our veterans.

By pursuing the recommendations of southern advisers, Pierce -- a New Englander -- hoped to ease the divisions that led eventually to Civil War. Franklin Pierce became President at a time of apparent tranquility. The United States, by virtue of the Compromise of 1850, seemed to have weathered its sectional storm. By pursuing the recommendations of southern advisers, Pierce--a New Englander--hoped to prevent still another outbreak of that storm. But his policies, far from preserving calm, hastened the disruption of the Union. Born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, in 1804, Pierce attended Bowdoin College. After graduation he studied law, then entered politics. At 24 he was elected to the New Hampshire legislature; two years later he became its Speaker. During the 1830's he went to Washington, first as a Representative, then as a Senator. Pierce, after serving in the Mexican War, was proposed by New Hampshire friends for the Presidential nomination in 1852. At the Democratic Convention, the delegates agreed easily enough upon a platform pledging undeviating support of the Compromise of 1850 and hostility to any efforts to agitate the slavery question. But they balloted 48 times and eliminated all the well-known candidates before nominating Pierce, a true ""dark horse."" Probably because the Democrats stood more firmly for the Compromise than the Whigs, and because Whig candidate Gen. Winfield Scott was suspect in the South, Pierce won with a narrow margin of popular votes. Two months before he took office, he and his wife saw their eleven-year-old son killed when their train was wrecked. Grief-stricken, Pierce entered the Presidency nervously exhausted. In his Inaugural he proclaimed an era of peace and prosperity at home, and vigor in relations with other nations. The United States might have to acquire additional possessions for the sake of its own security, he pointed out, and would not be deterred by ""any timid forebodings of evil."" Pierce had only to make gestures toward expansion to excite the wrath of northerners, who accused him of acting as a cat's-paw of Southerners eager to extend slavery into other areas. Therefore he aroused apprehension when he pressured Great Britain to relinquish its special interests along part of the Central American coast, and even more when he tried to persuade Spain to sell Cuba. But the most violent renewal of the storm stemmed from the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise and reopened the question of slavery in the West. This measure, the handiwork of Senator Stephen A. Douglas, grew in part out of his desire to promote a railroad from Chicago to California through Nebraska. Already Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, advocate of a southern transcontinental route, had persuaded Pierce to send James Gadsden to Mexico to buy land for a southern railroad. He purchased the area now comprising southern Arizona and part of southern New Mexico for $10,000,000. Douglas's proposal, to organize western territories through which a railroad might run, caused extreme trouble. Douglas provided in his bills that the residents of the new territories could decide the slavery question for themselves. The result was a rush into Kansas, as southerners and northerners vied for control of the territory. Shooting broke out, and ""bleeding Kansas"" became a prelude to the Civil War. By the end of his administration, Pierce could claim ""a peaceful condition of things in Kansas."" But, to his disappointment, the Democrats refused to renominate him, turning to the less controversial Buchanan. Pierce returned to New Hampshire, leaving his successor to face the rising fury of the sectional whirlwind. He died in 1869.

Brady Press Briefing Room 1:15 P.M. EST MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  Happy Valentine's Day.  I can sense the love in the room.  (Laughter.)   First off, last night, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control -- OFAC -- labeled the Venezuelan Vice President as a specially designated narcotics trafficker under the Kingpin Act.   Before I continue with the briefing and look forward to your questions, I want to turn it over for a short time to newly minted Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, to issue a brief statement on this and deliver a few questions. Secretary Mnuchin. SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Pleasure to be here on my first busy day in office.  Yesterday, the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, known as OFAC, designated Venezuelan national Tareck El Aissami as a specially designated narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking.  El Aissami's primary frontman, Venezuelan national Samark Lopez Bellow was also designated. These designations follow a multi-year investigation into El Aissami's criminal activities.  And President Trump appreciates the hard work put into this case by the Department of Treasury, the Department of State, as well as the National Security Council and many people throughout law enforcement. Following the signing of the executive order last week designing to break the back of criminal drug cartels, this action demonstrates the President's seriousness about fighting the scourge of drugs in the United States.  In addition, he wants to send a clear message to the people of Venezuela that America stands with them.   And with that, I'm happy to take two or three questions specifically about this. Q    Secretary Mnuchin, since sanctions are directly relevant, obviously, to the Treasury Department, which is an agency that you now oversee, can you talk a little bit about plans to sanction Russia and if you'll keep Obama-era sanctions against Russia? SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Our current sanctions programs are in place, and I would say sanctions are an important tool that we will continue to look at for various different countries.  But it's a very important program within the Treasury Department. Q    And for Russia specifically? SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  The existing policies are in place. Q    Mr. Secretary, are you contemplating any additional sanctions against Iran?  And can you tell us what you think the bottom line will be at these particular sanctions you announced yesterday and are referring to today with the Venezuelan Vice President?  What's it going to mean? SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Well, first, let me just comment -- again, this is as a result of a very long effort --  Q    Did you (inaudible) the implication, by the way? SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Yes, this was underway.  This was a very long effort.  But the implication is quite significant.  We expect that there will be frozen tens of millions of dollars and, again, that sanctions are a very important way of us sending a message that we will not stand for illicit activities, whether they're drug trafficking or terrorism.  Q    On Iran, sir? Q    Secretary, including sanctions, what other tools are you looking at? SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  I can't comment on all the tools, but, again, let me just reinforce that sanctions are a very important tool within the department and we will use them as appropriate.  Q    What about freezing assets? SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  In this case, we did freeze assets -- again, as I mentioned, tens of millions of dollars of assets.  And that will have a very big impact on this. So I'll take one more question please.  Yes, in the back. Q    During the campaign, the President had made comments about Janet Yellen and whether -- basically inferring that she was being too political and that she should be ashamed of herself.  Do the folks at the Treasury Department and within the administration feel confident with Mrs. Yellen at the helm and to be able to set monetary policy going forward? SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Well, let me just comment.  I'm really here today, again, to talk about the Venezuelan situation.  But let me just say that there is a tradition of the Secretary of Treasury having ongoing meetings with the head of the Federal Reserve, and I look forward to that now that I'm in office doing that and spending time with her. Thank you very much, everybody.  It's a pleasure to be here on my first day.   MR. SPICER:  All right, let's get back to the fun.  We've been reviewing -- and I want to address the events of last night, first and foremost.  We've been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks, trying to ascertain the truth.  We got to a point not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue, where a level of trust between the President and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change. The President was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the Vice President and others.  He was also very concerned in light of sensitive subjects dealt with by that position of national security advisors -- like China, North Korea and the Middle East -- that the President must have complete and unwavering trust for the person in that position. The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the President to ask for General Flynn’s resignation.  Immediately after the Department of Justice notified the White House Counsel of the situation, the White House Counsel briefed the President and a small group of senior advisors.  The White House Counsel reviewed and determined that there is not a legal issue, but rather a trust issue. During this process it’s important to note that the President did not have his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who he trusts immensely, approved by the Senate.  When the President heard the information as presented by White House Counsel, he instinctively thought that General Flynn did not do anything wrong, and the White House Counsel’s review corroborated that. It is not ordinary* [unordinary] for an incoming National Security Advisor to speak with his counterparts about the issues of concern to them.  In fact, he spoke with over 30 of his counterparts throughout the transition.  As Charles Krauthammer said last night, it is “perfectly reasonable for him to do so.”  The issue here was that the President got to the point where General Flynn’s relationship -- misleading the Vice President and others, or the possibility that he had forgotten critical details of this important conversation had created a critical mass and an unsustainable situation. That’s why the President decided to ask for his resignation, and he got it.  The irony of this entire situation is that the President has been incredibly tough on Russia.  He continues to raise the issue of Crimea, which the previous administration had allowed to be seized by Russia.  His Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, stood before the U.N. Security Council on her first day and strongly denounced the Russian occupation of Crimea.  As Ambassador Haley said at the time, the “dire situation in Eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.”   President Trump has made it very clear that he expects the Russian government to deescalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea.  At the same time, he fully expects to and wants to be able to get along with Russia, unlike previous administrations, so that we can solve many problems together facing the world, such as the threat of ISIS and terrorism. The President is currently evaluating a group of very strong candidates that will be considered to fill the National Security Advisor position permanently, and is confident in the ability of General Kellogg, a decorated and distinguished veteran of the United States Army, until that person is ultimately chosen. Before I get into the President’s schedule for today, a quick recap of the President’s activity over the last few days, since we haven’t had the honor of spending so much time together. The President has been keeping a close eye on the Oroville Dam situation in California.  We’ve worked closely with Doug LaMalfa, who represents California’s First District, where the dam is located, and other state officials to help people who have been impacted.  The situation is a textbook example of why we need to pursue a major infrastructure package in Congress.  Dams, bridges, roads, and all ports around the county have fallen into disrepair.  In order to prevent the next disaster, we will pursue the President’s vision for an overhaul of our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. We hope everyone remains safe as the evacuations continue, and we’ll be working alongside with FEMA and appropriate government entities to make sure that we are doing everything we can to attend to this matter.   The President was honored also to welcome the Prime Minister of Japan last week from their first official meeting at the White House to their joint press conference at Mar-a-Lago -- excuse me, their joint press conference and their time together at Mar-a-Lago.  The President and the Prime Minister had a productive visit that reaffirmed their determination to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance and economic relationship. At Mar-a-Lago, the President was proud to stand behind Prime Minister Abe on Saturday to convey the United States’ unwavering support for our Japanese allies in the face of North Korea’s most recent missile launch.  On Sunday, the President met with now-Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin and Mr. Steve Wynn before returning to Washington. Yesterday, the President had an incredibly productive set of meetings and discussions with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, focusing on our shared commitment to close cooperation in addressing both the challenges facing our two countries and the problems throughout the world.  Our countries share a profound economic interest with more than $2 billion in two-way trade flowing across our border every day.   The President was pleased to launch the Canada-United States Council for the Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders by holding a roundtable discussion here at the White House.  Together with Prime Minister Trudeau, his daughter Ivanka, the President discussed the unique challenges that women face in the workplace with an incredible group of successful and respected female business executives from both countries.  A full list of the participants is available through the pool. In addition to his in-person meetings with the prime ministers of Japan and Canada, the President also recently had phone calls with the presidents of Tunisia, Peru, Nigeria, Colombia and South Africa.  Readouts are available on all of those calls. Finally, following the Prime Minister's visit yesterday, the President met with Chairwoman McDaniel and Co-Chairman Paduchik of the Republican National Committee.  In the afternoon, the President participated in a pinning ceremony for Major Ricardo Turner, one of his military aides.  The aides to the President are mid-grade officers, one from of each of the services.  They provide direct support to the President in his role as Commander-in-Chief, and their primary responsibilities are to serve as an emergency action officer, aide-de-camp, and ceremonial aide.  It's a longstanding tradition that when the President's military aide is promoted to the next higher grade, the President conducts that promotion.  Major Ricardo Turner, the President's military aide, was recently promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and the promotion was held in the Oval Office. The President also spoke yesterday with Maureen Scalia on the one-year anniversary of her husband's passing.  The President and Mrs. Scalia discussed her late husband's incredible legacy, and how the President is making every effort to carry it on by nominating Judge Gorsuch, who shares the love of the Constitution, to succeed him on the bench. Last night, the President obviously hosted the swearing-in of Secretary Mnuchin in the Oval Office.  Secretary Mnuchin is a world-class financier whose decades of experience with financial and monetary matters make him the ideal person to spearhead the President's plan to develop a dynamic, booming economy that works for all Americans.  We're glad to officially have him on board. Now, moving on to the schedule for today -- this morning, the President and newly confirmed Secretary of Education DeVos held a parent-teacher conference meeting with parents and educators from public, private, charter, and home schools this morning.  The President opened the meeting by congratulating Secretary DeVos for her toughness and staying the course throughout her confirmation process.  He then discussed his vision for all Americans to have an opportunity to climb the ladder of success, starting with making quality education available to every child no matter their zip code. Under the current system, the President believes too many of our children are trapped in failing schools, especially in the African American community.  The President told the group to begin addressing this problem, which he views as a civil rights issue.  He wants parents to be able to decide what educational options are best for their children.  The group launched into a wide-ranging discussion that included public and charter schools, home-schooling, dropout prevention, and the BASIS Schools Program, states' responsibilities, and the current state of the U.S. Department of Education. The President's ultimate goal is to create safe communities, great schools, and well-paying jobs.  He believes that each of these goals is linked to the others, and the Trump administration is taking concrete steps to achieve them all. The President also spoke on the phone earlier today with Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom, continuing the productive conversation they started during her visit earlier this year.  A readout on that call should be coming soon.  The President then had lunch with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and his wife regarding combatting drug use. At 2:00, the President will sign House Joint Resolution 41 in the Oval Office.  The resolution is a start of rolling back harmful Obama-era regulations, which have cost the American business consumers a staggering $890 billion, making our companies less competitive and even driving some of them out of business.  The American free enterprise system is the greatest engine for economic prosperity in the world, but for too many, to reach its maximum potential, we must remove the barriers to productivity that are holding back our great workers and businesses.   Misguided federal regulations, such as the SEC rule addressed by HJR 41, inflict real cost on the American people and put our businesses, especially small businesses, at a significant disadvantage.  It's a priority for the Trump administration to fix our broken regulatory system so that it enhances American productivity and wellbeing without imposing unnecessary costs and burdens.  Signing this joint resolution is one more step towards achieving this goal.  Later this evening, the President will meet with Secretary Kelly and Attorney General Sessions to continue discussions on potential options for addressing the very clear national security threats we're facing in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling. Tomorrow, the President is pleased to be welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House.  They will discuss ways to advance and strengthen the special relationship between our two countries and stability in the Middle East.  They will consult on a range of issues -- regional issues -- including addressing the threats posed by Iran and its proxies, the crisis in Syria, and countering ISIS and other terrorist groups.   As the President has made clear, his administration will work to achieve comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so that Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security.  The way forward toward that goal will also be discussed between the President and the Prime Minister.  They will hold a joint press conference tomorrow, as well, and further guidance will be coming on the time and location.   Looking ahead to Friday, the President will travel to Charleston, South Carolina, to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner.  This visit will give the President an opportunity to celebrate a huge milestone for thousands of workers at Boeing, America’s number-one exporter and the millions of American workers involved in aerospace.  This trip has been months in the making, and we’re thrilled to celebrate the rollout of this amazing plane. With that, I’d be glad to take some of your questions.   Jonathan Karl. Q    Back in January, the President said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch with the Russians.  Now, today, can you still say definitively that nobody on the Trump campaign, not even General Flynn, had any contact with the Russians before the election? MR. SPICER:  My understanding is that what General Flynn has now expressed is that during the transition period -- well, we were very clear that during the transition period, he did speak with the ambassador --  Q    I’m talking about during the campaign. MR. SPICER:  I don’t have any -- there’s nothing that would conclude me -- that anything different has changed with respect to that time period. Q    And why would the President -- if he was notified 17 days ago that Flynn had misled the Vice President, other officials here, and that he was a potential threat to blackmail by the Russians, why would he be kept on for almost three weeks? MR. SPICER:  Well, that’s not -- that assumes a lot of things that are not true.  The President was informed of this.  He asked the White House Counsel to review the situation.  The first matter was whether there was a legal issue.  We had to review whether there was a legal issue, which the White House Counsel concluded there was not, as I stated in my comments.  This was an act of trust.  Whether or not he actually misled the Vice President was the issue, and that was ultimately what led to the President asking for and accepting the resignation of General Flynn.  That’s it, pure and simple.  It was a matter of trust.   We went through a very deliberative process, a very thorough review.  The first part of it was clearly to understand the legal aspect of this, and that was simply concluded there was no legal aspect.  And then what happened is the President evaluated the trust aspect of it. Major. Q    When the President was asked on Air Force One yesterday -- I mean, on Friday, rather, traveling down to Mar-a-Lago, about reports about conversations with the Russians about sanctions, he said, “I don’t know about it.  I’ll look into that.”  Was he being truthful?   MR. SPICER:  What he was asked specifically is was he aware of a Washington Post story.  He hadn’t seen that at the time.  Of course, he was involved; I just said that he was aware of the situation right after the White House Counsel informed him back in January. Q    And his inquiry to the White House Counsel was strictly about the legalities involved, not the propriety of the conversations between General Flynn and the Russian ambassador?   MR. SPICER:  Well, initially, just to be --  Q    Do you have any criticism of the merits of those conversations about sanctions before the Trump administration had been inaugurated? MR. SPICER:  So just to be clear, the acting Attorney General informed the White House Counsel that they wanted to give a “heads up” to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he had sent the Vice President out in particular.  The White House Counsel informed the President immediately.  The President asked him to conduct a review of whether there was a legal situation there.  That was immediately determined that there wasn’t.  That was what the President believed at the time, from what he had been told, and he was proved to be correct. The issue, pure and simple, came down to a matter of trust.  And the President concluded that he no longer had the trust of his national security advisor over -- Q    But was it proper for the incoming national security advisor, not part of an administration, to be discussing an issue as sensitive as sanctions with the Russian ambassador? MR. SPICER:  His job is to discuss issues with his counterparts.  I mean, Charles Krauthammer put it perfectly last night -- that’s what he’s supposed to be doing.  I mean, that’s his job.  We would constantly read out throughout the transition who he was speaking to, how he was getting ready.  The President was receiving congratulatory calls from around the world.  We would read out the world leader calls.   The job of the incoming NSA is to sit down with the counterparts and start that dialogue, and that’s exactly what he did.  So the question wasn’t did he do anything improper or legal, it’s a question of could he be trusted further.  And that trust, or the erosion of that trust, was, frankly, the issue. Q    Did the President instruct him to talk about sanctions with the Russian ambassador? MR. SPICER:  No, absolutely not.  No, no, no.  But that -- no.  And there’s no -- that’s never -- Q    So would he have preferred he had not done that? MR. SPICER:  Look, I think the President had no problem with the fact that he acted in accord with what his job was supposed to be doing.  He had an ability to talk about issues that were important, whether it was that or the 30 other countries that he spoke to.  That was part of his job, as has been noted by many people.  That’s what the national security advisor and, frankly, other positions do -- they begin the process of preparing their incoming job by talking to counterparts, people who have previously held the job, et cetera.  If he had not done that, there would be questions as to whether he’s properly prepared on day one.   Q    So he (inaudible) one conversation about sanctions. MR. SPICER:  No, the issue isn’t whether or not -- what he discussed.  There’s been a complete legal review of that, and there’s no issue with that.  The issue is whether or not he failed to properly inform the Vice President -- or not be honest with him, or not remember it.  But that’s the plain and simple issue.  And when he lost trust with the President, that’s when the President asked for and received his resignation. Q    Thanks a lot, Sean.  Yesterday, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the President, said that the President continued to have trust in General Flynn.   MR. SPICER:  Right. Q    What happened between yesterday morning and yesterday evening that led the President to lose confidence in General Flynn? MR. SPICER:  Well, I’m not going to get into the specifics of what the President’s thinking was, but I will just say, as I noted in the opening statement, that it was an evolving and eroding process.   And so at the end of the day, the President made a decision, as he does on all subjects, and asked for and received the national security advisor’s -- but he is one of those people that we’ve noted before -- when he is ready to make a decision, he makes it, whether it’s hiring somebody or asking for someone’s resignation.  Once he has determined that he’s made a decision on any subject, that’s when he informs his staff. So going into the day, it was an evolving situation.  He made a determination late in the day, and he executed on it. Yes, Alexis. Q    He’s an extremely loyal person, General Flynn.  Was it a difficult decision for the President to let General Flynn go? MR. SPICER:  Well, sure.  I mean, General Flynn is a dedicated public servant.  He’s headed the DIA, he has been an outstanding member of the Army, both as an officer and then as a flag officer.  He’s served this country admirably.  And I think the President appreciated his service to his nation, his commitment to his campaign, and his service to this country so far. But at some point, the decision came down on whether or not that that trust had eroded.  The important matters, as I mentioned, that are before the President when he’s dealing with issues of world matters, of all of the issues -- friends and allies, foes, hot spots -- he needs to rely on a national security advisor to give him sage advice.  And I think at a certain point, that guidance, that trust, eroded.  And the President, as he does on all matters, ultimately decides that when he's ready to make a decision, he executes. Alexis. Q    Sean, two questions.  Does the President believe that anything that he discussed with General Flynn during the transition might have been construed by the General as a request or an encouragement to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador?  That's question number one. MR. SPICER:  So -- oh, we're going to pause.  So, on the first, again, as I made clear, there's nothing that the General did that was a violation of any sort.  He was well within his duties to discuss issues of common concern between the two countries.  I will say it again:  What this came down to is a matter of trust.  The President was glad that he was out there conducting his job, preparing for his job, going back and forth with his counterparts throughout the world, much as the President had done with all of these world leaders calling the President, congratulating him, looking to set up calls for him once he was inaugurated.   Similarly, General Flynn was beginning that process with his counterparts throughout the world.  That was never of a concern to the President, from day one that he was briefed from the White House Counsel.  The issue, plain and simple, came down to a matter of trust.  And once that occurred, it was over. Q    On question number one, just to clarify, the President does not believe that any discussion that might have taken place -- and we know from intel, it did, on sanctions -- creates a problem for the President in any way -- that that is not a problem, that General Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russians? MR. SPICER:  No, there is -- I can't say it clearly enough.  There was nothing in what General Flynn did, in terms of conducting himself, that was an issue.  What it came down to, plain and simple, was him misleading the Vice President and others, and not having a firm grasp on his recollection of that.  That's it. Q    Question number two.  Lawmakers on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle would like to investigate or probe or ask more questions about this.  Does the President hope to cooperate with those investigations?  Would he instruct members of his staff who worked for him here and in the administration to cooperate with those investigations? MR. SPICER:  Well, we're going to comply with the law.  I think the President feels very confident the review that was conducted by White House Counsel was very thorough and concluded very conclusively, as he had first come to -- instinctively come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong.  So people are free to do what they wish, but I think that they will find exactly what the President first believed and what the White House Counsel concluded.  And, frankly, I believe a couple publications even reported that there was no investigation for a reason -- because there was not an issue of law, it was an issue of trust. George. Q    When do you expect to have a replacement in place?  And secondly, on another topic, there was a report yesterday that one of your colleagues said the White House is keeping dossiers on reporters.  Can you say if that's true or not? MR. SPICER:  That is absolutely not true.  There are no dossiers being kept.  It's just a binder that I put right here, that's about it.  That was a joke.  Hold on one second.  And then, I'm sorry, George, the first part? Q    Timetable on a replacement. MR. SPICER:  Just like the way he handled this situation, the President will meet with individuals, and when he's ready to make a decision and he feels as though the person is qualified and can properly advise him on the issue, he'll make that decision.  But that, as all decisions, rests with him. I'm just going to go to my first Skype seat.  John Huck of WKVVU out of Las Vegas. John. Q    Thank you so much on behalf of our viewers here in Southern Nevada for the opportunity to join you today.  As you know, Sean, Las Vegas has suffered terribly in the last recession -- more so than perhaps any other city in the country.  As the administration moves forward with repealing financial regulations and possibly rolling back Dodd-Frank, what guarantees can you make to Nevadans that those actions won't lead banks and investments banks to re-engage with the risky financial behaviors that tanked our economy the last time and left taxpayers here on the hook to bail those banks out? MR. SPICER:  Thanks, John.  I think one of the things -- if you look at the intent of Dodd-Frank, it was to make sure that we didn't have institutions that were too big to fail.  And frankly, it has actually created institutions that are now too big to fail.  Dodd-Frank actually did exactly the opposite of what it intended to do.  And I think when you look at the regulation HJR 41 that the President is signing today, this is another example of the President taking decisive action to roll back regulations that are, frankly, creating more of a burden on our nation's banks and businesses than helping them. I think the President is going to be very clear with making sure that we do things that build up the goal of what Dodd-Frank actually intended to do.  But right now, we actually, through Dodd-Frank, put taxpayers more on the hook than we let them off.  We've created more institutions and created more guarantees for the federal government to bail out some of these institutions if they exceed their authority. John Roberts. Q    Let me go back to what you said at the beginning.  You said the White House Counsel's Office reviewed this and determined that there was nothing illegal.  What evidence did they look at in making this determination?  And secondly, Democrats up on the Hill say that they want an investigation of this.  They're looking into what did the President know and when did he know it.  So can you tell us what evidence you looked at the White House Counsel's Office, and what did the President know about all of this and when was he aware of it? MR. SPICER:  Well, as I mentioned, the first day that the Department of Justice made White House Counsel available -- or sought to notify White House Counsel was January 26th.  The President was immediately informed of the situation.  As I said, based on the information that was provided at the time, the view was that this was not a violation.  He was proved instinctively correct.  And White House Counsel at that time undertook an extensive review both of materials and questioning -- Q    Did they -- MR. SPICER:  I'm not going to get into the specifics.  What I will tell you is, on multiple occasions they had an exhaustive and extensive questioning of General Flynn on several occasions based on information that was provided to them, or materials that were provided to them to review.  I'm not going to get into the details of that, but I will just say that there was an exhaustive review.   And again, the thing that's important to note is the Vice President and myself -- in fact, I think the first time I brought this issue up was January 13 -- the Department of Justice didn’t notify the White House or the White House Counsel at that time in the transition phase until 13 days later.   So I think it's important to understand something very, very important:  This idea of why did it take so long -- I think the first question should be, where was the Department of Justice in this.  They were aware of this.  We were making statements based on what General Flynn was telling us, starting on January 13th.  The Vice President went out on the 15th, right?  They didn’t notify the White House Counsel's Office until January 26th.  At that time, there was an immediate -- the President was immediately informed of that and then asked the White House Counsel to conduct a very, very thorough review.  The first part of that review was focused on whether or not there was any legal issue -- that's it.  Once that became the issue, then there was a -- it shifted into phase two, which is whether or not there was trust still maintained.  Then that became a separate set of issues that were -- Q   I understand.  I'm speaking to the actual evidence, that the FBI has transcripts of these intercepts, which I assume were done by the NSA via a FISA Court order.  Was there any communication between the White House Counsel's Office and the FBI?  Did those transcripts ever enter -- MR. SPICER:  I will say that obviously -- there was obviously communication between the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel's Office.  I'm not going to get into the specific nature of that.  I think it would be inappropriate because of the nature of the information that was being discussed. Yes. Q    Why not dismiss the General on January 27th?  Why, if the question was of trust, and immediately you have on the 15th, he's on ""Face the Nation"" saying that -- the Vice President on ""Face the Nation"" saying that this is what General Flynn told me, and then January 26th you hear the opposite -- why not immediately act?  Why wait another two and a half weeks? MR. SPICER:  I don’t understand how that's a due process.  Because what the -- the Attorney General didn’t come -- the Acting Attorney General -- come in and say that there was an issue.  She said, we wanted to give you a head's up that there may be information, okay?  She could not confirm there was an investigation.  And so it would be unbelievably short-sighted and wrong to go in and dismiss someone immediately.  In fact, what the President did was take decisive action to make sure that the White House Counsel thoroughly reviewed and vetted the situation.  He took immediate, decisive action.  And if you look at the timeline in terms of what he did and how that expanded, the White House Counsel's first and foremost goal was to make sure that there was not a legal issue at hand.  Once that was concluded, then it became a phase of determining whether or not the General's action on this and a whole host of other issues undermined his trust in the President.  But the President, from day one, from minute one, was unbelievably decisive in asking for and demanding that his White House Counsel and their team review the situation, first and foremost, to question whether it's a legal issue.  And what they immediately determined -- not immediately, but within several days, was that, after review, that there was not a legal issue, and then it moved into a second phase. Mara. Q    So wait -- because the President tweeted this morning that the real story is leaks -- illegal leaks. MR. SPICER:  It is leaks.  But if you think about this -- understand that all of this information was leaked.  I mean, I got to -- and again, I know we've got me lecturing you about what the story should be, but I think that there's a real story here.  The idea that not just in this administration, but the Obama administration going back to the Bush administration and back, that we have an issue where classified information, of which this would be, is handled in such a way that it is being given out.   And I know in some cases it's a good story, and I understand that, and that's to some degree your responsibility to write that.  But I think there's also a story here, with the amount of leaks that are coming out of people that are entrusted with national security secrets and classified information are leaking it out.  That's a real concern for this President; that when he's talking on the phone with a world leader, that when he's making key decisions that are in the interest of protecting this country, that we have to wonder whether or not people who work for our government, who are entrusted with classified information and decision-based materials are leaking that information out.  That, I do believe, is a big story that should be reported.  I also believe that the President is, rightly so, very, very concerned about this, because it's not just something that is plaguing the current situation, but it goes back through the Obama administration, the Bush administration, the Clinton administration.  When we have government employees that are entrusted with this and then leak it out, that undermines our national security, frankly. Trey. Q    Hold on -- MR. SPICER:  Sorry, I apologize, Mara. Q    I know you just forgot.  I have a question, but I want you to clarify something you just said to John.  Are you saying that no one has read the transcripts of the calls, or you just don’t want to tell us whether they --  MR. SPICER:  I said that I'm not going to comment on it. Q    Okay.  So my question is about sanctions.  You were very specific in talking about the sanctions against Crimea and that he doesn’t want to lift them until Crimea is returned.  But the sanctions that Flynn was discussing were the sanctions for the election hacking. MR. SPICER:  Right. Q    That's something the President could remove on his own if he wanted to.  Is he committed to keeping those? MR. SPICER:  I think Secretary Mnuchin commented on that.  There's no change in our current sanctions strategy with Russia, and I've got nothing for you on that. Trey. Q    Given that the current story is leaks, what is the President willing to do to investigate further to determine where these leaks are coming from? MR. SPICER:  Yeah, again, I think this goes back to the same way he negotiates.  Telling people what we’re going to do to cover up additional leaks wouldn’t be a very sound strategy when it comes to making sure that that doesn’t happen again.  The President has been very clear, whether he’s negotiating or dealing with an issue like this, you don’t telegraph to people how you’re going to handle it. Q    Sean -- MR. SPICER:  Hold on, Trey gets a follow-up.  Everyone else got one. Q    So he is going to take some sort of steps to investigate these leaks that the administration -- MR. SPICER:  I would just say that the President, as I said, is clearly upset about this.  He understands the threat that they pose to our national security, and he’s going to make sure that he continues to take action to make sure that that stops. Yes. Q    Thank you.  So you’ve mentioned time and time again that this is an issue of trust.  You also said that it was an evolving issue, and that the issue of the trust that the President had for Flynn came down to this deception that happened with the Vice President but also a host of whole other -- of other issues.  What were the other issues?  And was the Vice President the only person that was misled by Flynn?  Were other people misled? MR. SPICER:  I mean, I think I've stood before you before and explained what General Flynn had conveyed to me.  I think there were some others that he had similarly expressed that to, as well.  So that’s why it’s others, because it wasn’t just people who went out and made public pronouncements and a series of questioning that was rather exhaustive over a long period of time.  He continued to maintain that that had not occurred, and I think that’s where the President continued to -- and that’s why the President was very clear that it was an eroding issue.  Because it was after a series of issues and a series of statements and pronouncements that the President came to that conclusion. Q    Were there other issues outside of this call and the deception over that that led to the mistrust with Flynn? MR. SPICER:  I think the statement is very clear that it was this and a series of issues.   With that, let me go to Jason Stevens of the Federalist Paper in Ashland, Ohio. Q    Thank you.  What our readers at the Federalist Papers Project are most interested in is returning the country to the first principles of republican government as understood by the American Founders.  One of those principles, in the Declaration of Independence, is the consent of the governed.  So my question is this:  What are the President’s future plans for rolling back the expensive and burdensome regulations of the administrative state, most of which are the product of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats who never received the consent of the governed to do anything, let alone make law? MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Jason.  I think, as I mentioned today, the President, in just a few minutes, is going to be signing HJR 41, which is one of those attempts to roll back some onerous Dodd-Frank regulations with respect to the SEC in particular.   He is going to continue -- last week we rolled out another one of those executive orders that ensures that for every new regulation, two must be gotten rid of.  The President’s commitment to rolling back regulation and the overreach of government, I think, is unwavering and unquestionable.  So you’re going to continue to see this President undo a lot of that government overreach. Jim. Q    Yeah, just a quick question.  You said earlier in your comments that the President has been incredibly tough on Russia.  How is that possible?  He has made comment after comment over the course of the campaign, the transition, where he defended Vladimir Putin.  He had an interview with Bill O’Reilly where he, when he was asked if Vladimir Putin is a killer, he said, well, America hasn’t been that much better in this regard also.   To me it seems, and I think to a lot of Americans it seems that this President has not been tough on Russia.  How can you say that? MR. SPICER:  Because I just walked through it.  I think there’s a difference between the President wanting to have an understanding of how a good relationship with Russia can help us defeat ISIS and terrorism throughout the world.   Look, the Obama administration tried to have a reset with Russia.  They failed.  They tried to tell Russia not to invade Crimea.  They failed.  This President understands that it’s in America’s national and economic interests to have a healthy relationship.  If he has a great relationship with Putin in Russia, great.  If he doesn’t, then he’ll continue on.  But he’s not going to just assume that because it wasn’t able to happen in the past -- I think you’ve seen, with Prime Minister Abe in particular and others, that the reset that Prime Minister Netanyahu talked about tomorrow -- so many of these countries from around the globe are looking forward to resetting the relationships that this country has with them; that they feel as though they were abandoned over the last eight years, and that they are excited about the prospect of a new U.S. relationship under a Trump administration. But with respect to Russia, I think the comments that Ambassador Haley made at the U.N. were extremely forceful and very clear that until -- Q    That was an announcement from Haley, not the President. MR. SPICER:  She speaks for the President.  I speak for the President.  All of us in this administration.  And so all of the actions and all of the words in this administration are on behalf and at the direction of this President.  So I don’t think we could be any clearer on the President’s commitment. Katie Pavlich. Q    Quick little follow-up, because I haven’t had any follow-ups or questions in a while.  But anyway -- MR. SPICER:  Really? Q    No -- the other question is, just getting back to what was asked a few moments ago about trust and being misled.  Are you saying that the national security advisor was intentionally misleading the President, the Vice President, yourself when he made these comments to you about that conversation? MR. SPICER:  No, look, the trust is given by the President.  It’s a relationship between he and any individual.  And so, as I mentioned in the comments, maybe it was because -- I don't know that it was intentional, he may have just forgotten, but I think at some point trust isn’t just --  Q    Isn't that kind of a weird thing to forget, though, in a conversation where you talk about --  MR. SPICER:  But that’s the point, Jim, is that at some point that trust eroded to a point where the President did not feel comfortable with him serving in that position, and asked for and received his resignation. Katie Pavlich.  Q    Sean, on the trust issue and the eroding of trust, last night, in General Flynn’s resignation letter, he said he inadvertently briefed the Vice President-elect and others with incomplete information. MR. SPICER:  Right. Q    Considering his role in advising the President on national security matters, is the White House concerned that he maybe briefed the President-elect, Vice President-elect with incomplete information on other matters of national security in addition to his phone calls with the Russian ambassador? MR. SPICER:  Well, when you look at the team, it’s not one person in isolation, Katie.  It’s several.  You’ve got General Kelly on the homeland security front, General Mattis on the DOD front -- he’s got an entire national security staff and apparatus that briefs him -- you know, Director Pompeo at the CIA, and others from the DNI’s office that come in and brief him on a whole host of issues.  So it’s not a single position. Q    So was his situation an isolated incident of giving incomplete -- MR. SPICER:  Well, yeah.  Regardless of whether it’s a single situation, it’s not as though there’s one person briefing him.  And the President synthesizes a lot of information, both written and stuff that is briefed to him, and ultimately it is he who makes that decision based a lot on what he already knows, what he is presented with.  So the President gets information from a lot of people -- generals, admirals, people in the military community, ambassadors, people in the State Department, an exhaustive team at the National Security Council, and then makes an ultimate decision based on that and what he already knows to be the case. Q    Sean, you’ve been asked a couple times about these transcripts of calls.  Will the White House declassify those and release them? MR. SPICER:  Looks, it is inappropriate for me to comment on those at this time.  Right now, the focus is on some of the evolving issues that were going around the globe, as you know. Q    Will you be open to it? MR. SPICER:  Let me answer the question.  It is not an issue that has come up.  I think the President right now is focused on replacing his national security advisor, making sure that he’s presented with the best possible information to make these key decisions. But at this time, we also have got to be careful that we were not involving ourselves in a matter of national security.  And the review, as I mentioned, was done and then immediately last night when the President felt as though it was time for a decision, made it.  That’s where we are in this iteration of the process.  If we have anything further for you, we will update you. I want to go to Joyce Kaufman of WFTL Talk News in Palm Beach, Florida. Q    Thank you so much for this opportunity.  I’m approximately six miles away from Mar-a-Lago right now, and the President met with Prime Minister Abe from Japan at Mar-a-Lago this weekend.  And besides giving us traffic and security nightmares, there were apparently conversations that took place by telephone and with the Prime Minister that were in a relatively insecure dining area.  There is already video of this surfacing.  Will there be a SCIF put in place in these dining areas, these public places?  And one last question.  When he meets with Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow, will they be discussing moving the embassy, and settlements? MR. SPICER:  On the second one, I’m not going to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s discussion with the President.  We’ll have a readout.  After that, there will be a press conference. With respect to the first, there is a SCIF at Mar-a-Lago.  And just to be clear, the briefing -- the President was briefed in a SCIF ahead of dinner.  He went with his national security team.  They briefed him on the situation in North Korea.  Subsequently, he had a dinner, of which was attended exclusively by U.S. and Japanese delegation members.  At that time, apparently there was a photo taken, which everyone jumped to nefarious conclusions about what may or may not be discussed.  There was simply a discussion about press logistics, where to host the event.  And then after the dinner, the President went back into the SCIF to get a further update from his team. So I’m not really sure where people jumped to conclusions.  There is a SCIF there.  It was utilized on two occasions that evening to convey to the President by his national security team the situation in North Korea.  And then the President subsequently stood shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese President to make sure that our commitment to their security and stand against North Korea was fully made aware. Margaret. Q    Sean, can you just clarify, because I got a little turned around -- did President Trump, or President-elect Trump at the time, know of General Flynn’s discussion of the sanctions while he was NSC-designate?  And if not, when did he finally learn about them?  And if so, why was he okay with that? MR. SPICER:  So, no, he was not aware, as he’s not back-briefed on every conversation that his national security team has or other staffers.  They were performing their duties, as other people were in terms of getting up to speed, conveying with counterparts and previous members of their team.   That being said, when he was made aware of it, once the White House Counsel briefed him on concerns the Department of Justice had -- and at that point, as I mentioned, what he asked and what he believed at the time and was confirmed by White House Counsel was that there was no legal issue here.  Discussing the issue didn’t violate anything; it was appropriate in the normal course of action to discuss that.  And he immediately asked the White House Counsel to further confirm what his instincts were at the time. Thank you, guys.  Have a great one.  We’ve got everybody for a bill signing.  We’ve got a bill signing.  Q    I didn’t get my -- MR. SPICER:  Oh, he’s got -- Margaret gets a follow-up, but he’s got -- Q    Are you -- is the administration undertaking any sort of effort, either Cabinet-wide or, like, inside the shop to make sure that everyone comes forward who had any communications with the Russians about sanctions or otherwise? MR. SPICER:  There’s no other information.  I mean, as far as we are aware, that is an isolated incident that occurred.  And again, the key point in this isn’t that there were discussions.  There was nothing wrong or inappropriate about those discussions.  It purely came down to a matter of trust.  That’s it. Thank you, guys.  See you tomorrow.  Happy Valentine’s Day.  END  2:00 P.M.

EST PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I'm honored to be here with Prime Minister Trudeau, whose father I knew and respected greatly.  And he gave me a picture of myself and your father, and what a great picture.  I will keep that in very special place -- at the Waldorf Astoria, together.   We're going to launch the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs.  We have some of the great ones in this room -- and business leaders.  We have so many great women leaders around the table today, and we're going to go through your names exactly, because many of you I know, some of you I don’t, so I want to find out all about you.   Women, as you know, I can say that from my past life, I had so many women executives who were phenomenal -- phenomenal -- and really helped me a great deal in business.  So it was really fantastic.  They play a tremendously important role, women in our economy.  Women are the primary source of income in 40 percent of American households and households with children under the age of 18.  In order to create economic growth and lots of very good, well-paying jobs, we must ensure that our economy is a place where women can work and thrive.  And I think that's happening in the United States much more so, and Ivanka is very much involved in this.  And I appreciate you being involved in it.   And I know, Justin, in Canada it's happening big league, and it's very important.  We need policies that help to keep women in the workforce and to address the unique barriers faced by female entrepreneurs -- and they are unique.  We need to make it easier for women to manage the demands of having both a job and a family, and we also need to make it easier for women entrepreneurs to get access to capital.  And I guess pretty much all entrepreneurs, we have to help them out, because the system is not working so well for entrepreneurs getting capital.  But it's in particular difficult for women, so we're going to get access to markets and access to networks.   And I look forward to hearing your advice.  We're going to go around the table, and I want to really learn something today.  And again, it's a great honor to be with you.  And, Justin, I can say on behalf of our country, it's an honor to be with you. PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Thank you, Donald, for welcoming us.  And I’m really excited about launching this, sitting around the table here with a number of successful executives who just happen to be women.  One of the things that I’ve been lucky enough to do over the past year in New York and Beijing and across Canada is sit down with women CEOs, women executives to talk about both their successes and the challenges they’re facing that are particular, but also how, of course, we create more paths to success for women across our community and across our society. Whenever I sit down with a woman executive, I know that she has had to overcome significant barriers that exist, and therefore is likely to have greater insight into how to help reduce those barriers for others, but also be a formidable contributor to the success of business and her economy. So I think for me, it’s not just about doing the right thing, it’s about understanding that women in leadership positions is a very powerful leverage for success, for business, for communities, and for our entire economy.   (Speaks in French.) It’s a great pleasure to sit with you now and to hear from your extraordinary leadership.   PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  So how about we start with Ivanka, we go around the room.  Ivanka, you might just want to say a couple of words. MS. TRUMP:  Welcome.  I’m honored to be here, and really looking forward to hearing from each of you who serve as tremendous role models for me and so many other business leaders.  (Inaudible) our countries can lend some tremendously valuable perspective as we think about the unique challenges that entrepreneurs, women in the workforce, female small-business owners are confronted with each and every day.  And as we think about how we level the playing field for this generation and for the next. So thank you for being here.  And I look forward to hearing from you today. MR. FARRELL:  Thank you.  I’m Dawn Farrell and I’m from a company called TransAlta, which is located in Alberta, where you're going to build the Keystone Pipeline. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  A big chunk of it, that’s right. MS. FARRELL:  So thanks for the opportunity to contribute to this important dialogue, and a dialogue that we’ve had for 100 -- over hundreds of years.  My company is in the business of making electricity.  We generate electricity from coal, natural gas, and also from renewable sources -- wind, hydro and solar.  We have operations in Canada, the United States and in Australia.   And, really, for us to excel, we have to be excellent at operations, engineering, finance and trading, and we have to excel in the public policy dialogue that happens around energy.  And I’ll talk about that as part of today, because we’ve done some excellent work with the Trudeau government. Now, future jobs in our space absolutely depend on growth.  There’s no question of that.  And I truly believe for there to be future opportunities for women, we have to have growth, because the more jobs there are, the more opportunities.  And collaborations like this where we break down barriers and simplify, and build trust and build confidence -- because I think businesses invest when there’s confidence.  And my hope is that’s what comes out of here.   Now, for us, having operations in Canada and the United States makes us absolutely more competitive.  Our Centralia operation, which is in Washington State, is one of the most competitive plants.  They have twice won our most coveted award for plant of the year.  But the reality is, teams of people from the United States and teams of people from Canada cross the border often to work with each other to share and to -- so that we can excel as a company overall.  So it's huge --  PRESIDENT TRUMP:  That's good.  Well, we're going to go around.  Thank you.  Good job.  Boy, she did a hell of a job.  (Laughter.)  Wow, no wonder she's successful.  (Laughter.)   Monique, thank you.  MS. LEROUX:  Monique Leroux.  I am the chair of the Board of the Quebec Investment Fund and the chair of the Economy Council of the province.  I'm also a board member of large, global corporations like S&P Global, Michelin, and Couche-Tard, which is a very interesting Canadian company.  Each of those organizations, of course, have significant businesses in the U.S. and also employs a lot of people in this country. I feel really honored and privileged to be part of the council.  I would like to thank you for this great opportunity. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you. MS. LEROUX:  We have long history of cooperation, and I think that for the woman agenda it will contribute a lot for our great countries.   PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you, Monique.  Appreciate it. MS. LEE:  My name is Tina Lee.  I'm CEO of T&T Supermarket.  We're Canada's largest Asian supermarket chain.  I employ 5,000 staff and serve 500,000 people across the country every week. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Wow.  Fantastic. MS. LEE:  Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you. MS. STEPHENSON:  I'm Carol Stephenson.  I'm on the board of directors at General Motors, and I don't think that General Motors needs any introduction.  (Laughter.) PRESIDENT TRUMP:  No, we had -- Mary Barra was here last week, and she's terrific. MS. STEPHENSON:  She is. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  Thank you very much. MS. LUNDGREN:  I'm Tamara Lundgren.  I'm the president and CEO of Schnitzer Steel Industries, which is one of the world's largest recyclers of metal products, sold to steel mills around the world.  I also sit on the board of Parsons Corporation, which has been a big participant in the public-private partnerships in Canada.  And I sit on the board of Ryder, which goes back and forth between the U.S. and Canada over 400 times every day.  And lastly, I'm the chair of the board of the Portland branch of the 12th District Federal Reserve Board. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Very good.  Thank you very much. MS. ALLAN:  Hello, Elyse Allan.  I'm vice president of GE, as well as GE's operations in Canada.  And we're a digital industrial company.  We have business in 190 countries in the world. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Right.  That's good.  Good, thank you. MS. VERSCHUREN:  I'm Annette Verschuren.  I'm the CEO of NRStor, which is an energy storage development company.  Half of my career I've worked with U.S. based companies -- Home Depot, (inaudible) and Michaels -- craft store.  I think that our countries are so absolutely bound together by our people, our resources, our trade.  Linda Hasenfratz and I worked for many years on North American competitiveness and found ways in which we could get products and services and people through the border efficiently because, as you know, we're the biggest trading partners in the world. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we're going to be working on that very closely over the next very short period of time.  There are some new things happening that can be very good.  Thank you very much. MS. SWEET:  Hello, I'm Julie Sweet.  I'm CEO of North America for Accenture, responsible for both the U.S. and Canadian businesses.   PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you. MS. HASENFRATZ:  Hi, I'm Linda Hasenfratz.  I'm CEO of Linamar Corporation.  We're a diversified manufacturing company.  We have 57 plants and 25,000 employees around the world, including right here in the U.S. and, of course, also heavily invested in Canada.  We've doubled our workforce in the U.S. over the last five years.  We've also doubled our workforce in Canada over the last five years and have a lot of exciting opportunities for growth.  We're mainly in the auto parts and access equipment sectors. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you, everybody. END  12:24 P.M.

THIS PRIVACY POLICY DESCRIBES WHAT INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND HOW THAT INFORMATION IS USED AND RETAINED, AND PROVIDES INFORMATION ON: INFORMATION WE RECEIVE (WHEN YOU PROVIDE IT, VISIT WHITEHOUSE.GOV, USE THE WHITEHOUSE.GOV MOBILE APP, RECEIVE EMAIL UPDATES, OR INTERACT WITH OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE PRESENCES ON THIRD-PARTY SITES) HOW THIS INFORMATION IS USED SHARING OF THIS INFORMATION DATA RETENTION THIRD-PARTY TOOLS AND SITES CHILDREN AND PRIVACY SECURITY IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS POLICY OR SUGGESTIONS FOR ITS IMPROVEMENT, PLEASE LET US KNOW AT WHITEHOUSE.GOV/PRIVACY/FEEDBACK. EN ESPAÑOLInformation Received and Retained by White House Online Platforms Information You Give Us You do not have to provide the White House with any personal information or create a user account to access information on WhiteHouse.gov. However, for some services, we may need some personal information from you such as your name, address, telephone number, and email address. For example: The “Contact the White House” form asks for basic contact information so we can respond to your request; When we ask users to share their story or how a policy decision will impact them, we generally ask for their name, zip code, and email address; Creating a user account for our online petitions platform “We the People” requires a valid email address and a first and last name; and We may ask for personal information from people applying to, registering for, or participating in a White House event or competition. Visits to WhiteHouse.gov When you visit WhiteHouse.gov, the following basic information is automatically received and stored by the web servers hosting WhiteHouse.gov: The originating Internet Protocol (IP) address; The internet domain name; Information about your computer or mobile set-up (e.g., type and version of web browser, operating system, screen resolution, and connection speed); The pages on WhiteHouse.gov that you visit; The internet address, or URL, of the website that connected you to our site, if you accessed WhiteHouse.gov via a link on another page (i.e., “referral traffic”); and The amount of data transmitted from WhiteHouse.gov to your computer. The White House also uses web measurement and customization technologies (such as “cookies""). You can choose not to accept cookies from any website, including WhiteHouse.gov, by changing your browser settings. Click here to learn more about how we use cookies. Using the WhiteHouse.gov Mobile Application When you use the WhiteHouse.gov Mobile Application (“App”), the App pulls content from the White House website, generating the same basic information as when you visit WhiteHouse.gov (see Visits to WhiteHouse.gov). The WhiteHouse.gov Mobile App does not collect geolocation information or use location services. You may sign up to receive “push notification” messages via a third party provider (currently Urban Airship). To make sure messages reach the correct devices, our third party provider relies on a device token unique to your mobile device. While we may be able to access a list of the tokens, the App and tokens do not reveal your identity, unique device ID, or contact information to us. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving push notifications, simply adjust your phone settings or remove the App. The White House receives aggregate data about the use of our App, such as the number of people who have opened the App from a third party provider (currently Google Analytics). We also receive aggregate data from the platforms that distribute our App (currently the iTunes Store and Google Play Store), such as the number of people who download the App and mobile set-up information (e.g., device model, App version, country, language, and mobile carrier). Please consult the privacy policies of these third parties for further information. Email Subscriptions In order to manage White House email subscription lists, we retain the names and email address of our email subscribers, as well as other information they may have shared with us (e.g., addresses and phone numbers), logs of emails we send, and automatically generated email data used to improve our email communications. This automatically generated email data (generated through simple tools such as “pixel tags” and link redirects) includes: The recipient’s email client; Whether the email was opened; If a link in the message was clicked; Whether an email was delivered; If the email was forwarded; and If the email was printed. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving our messages, simply click on the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each email message. Third-Party Websites The White House maintains official pages or accounts on third-party websites in order to better engage with the American public (a current list is here). Your activity on those sites is governed by the third-party website’s security and privacy policies. Users of third-party sites often share information with the general public, user community, and/or the third-party operating the site. Consequently, you should review the privacy policies of third-party sites before using them and ensure that you understand how your information may be shared and used. You should also adjust privacy settings on your account on any third-party site to match your preferences. For the sole purpose of complying with the Presidential Records Act, the White House archives some information that users submit or publish when engaging with the White House through official White House pages or accounts on third-party websites (e.g., by sending a message, posting a comment, “following,” “friending,” or taking similar actions). This information may contain personal information, such as an individual’s username and other public account information, when such information is available based on the user’s privacy settings and the terms of the site. For example: On Twitter, the White House automatically archives “tweets” from official White House accounts, “direct messages” sent to or from official White House accounts, and “mentions” (tweets from other users to official White House accounts; these tweets contain an @ and the username of an official White House account (e.g., @WhiteHouse). The White House also automatically archives any status that official accounts have “favorited.” On Facebook, the White House automatically archives all content created by official White House pages, content that tags an official White House page, and any content posted on official White House pages (for example, the number of likes to the page and comments posted). On Google+, the White House automatically archives all content posted by official White House accounts, as well as the number of likes/comments/shares on each of those posts (including the comments themselves). The White House also automatically archives the total number of Google+ users that have added our page to a “Circle,” and the list of users that White House accounts have added to “Circles.” For aggregate statistical analysis and to improve the quality of our services, we may integrate web measurement tools with our social media pages. These tools enable basic analysis of social media traffic (such as the number of people visiting a certain page) and do not collect personally identifiable information. How Information is Used If you choose to provide us with information, we may use that information to contact you, respond to your message or petition, or provide you the information or services you requested. In order to serve you better, we may analyze multiple sources of data you have provided (for example, to look up whether you previously contacted the White House about the same topic so that we do not send you a duplicative response). We may also use messages or comments collected through WhiteHouse.gov or official social media pages for our own purposes, such as to inform policy decisions or in public advocacy. We may use data you provide and automatically generated data for statistical analysis to assess, for example, what information is of interest to users, technical design specifications, and system performance. This allows us to make general improvements to our site as well as to offer tailored content to email subscribers (e.g., a follow-up message to subscribers interested in a specific topic based on information they have provided or automatically generated data). Sharing of this Information Information you choose to share with the White House (directly and via third party sites) may be treated as public information. We may, for example, publish compilations of messages or comments collected through WhiteHouse.gov or official social media pages and provide them to national leaders, members of the press, or other individuals outside of the Federal Government. And the We the People API allows public access to some We the People signature data. However, we exercise discretion to limit such disclosures to protect your privacy (for example, we generally do not publish last names of commenters). The White House uses a third-party analytics provider (currently Google Analytics) to analyze data from cookies. The third-party analytics provider does not receive personally identifiable information through these cookies. We have also limited the provider’s ability to see your full IP address (a process known as “IP masking”). Please review Google Analytics’ privacy policy for additional information. Within the White House, we restrict access to personally identifiable information to employees, contractors, and vendors subject to non-disclosure requirements who require access to this information in order to perform their official duties and exercise controls to limit what data they can view based on the specific needs of their position. In some cases, we may share information you have provided or automatically generated information with other government agencies in response to lawful law enforcement requests or to protect WhiteHouse.gov from security threats. Additionally, if you seek assistance on a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency, we may share your information with that agency for the limited purpose of addressing your request for assistance. We do not use or share your information for commercial purposes and, except as described above, we do not exchange or otherwise disclose this information. Data Retention Under the Presidential Records Act (PRA), we are generally required to retain information until the end of the current Administration, at which time it will be transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). NARA may eventually release this material to the public, but will withhold any information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy if released. Access to this information may be requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) five years after the end of the current Administration. NARA or the White House may choose to dispose of information lacking in historical value through procedures under the PRA. The White House currently disposes of certain information under those procedures: Server log entries are retained for one year (for example, server logs from June 2011 will be deleted in June 2012); Aggregate data on Mobile App use is retained until the end of the current Administration. Cookie data linked to individual users will be retained for 13 months; Other cookie data will be retained by the White House until the end of the current Administration; and Automatically generated email data will be retained by the White House until the end of the current Administration. Third-Party Tools and Sites Links to External Sites WhiteHouse.gov and other White House platforms and pages may link to websites created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations and individuals. When you follow a link to an external site, you are leaving WhiteHouse.gov and are subject to the external site‘s privacy and security policies. We do not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information contained on an external site. We also do not endorse the site’s sponsor, any views they express, or any products or services they offer. White House Pages on Third-Party Websites Your activity on those sites (a current list is here) is governed by the third-party website’s security and privacy policies. The White House has conducted and published a Privacy Impact Assessment of Third-Party Sites, which includes more information about these issues and can be accessed here. White House Content Embedded in Third-Party Sites In some instances, a third-party website may feature embedded White House content served by WhiteHouse.gov. For example, other websites might embed the WhiteHouse.gov’s “Taxpayer Receipt” calculator. The embedded WhiteHouse.gov content automatically generates White House server logs (see Visits to WhiteHouse.gov) and may set a White House cookie (see Cookies). Children and Privacy on WhiteHouse.gov We believe in the importance of protecting the privacy of children online. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child’s parent or guardian is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child under age 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under age 13. If you believe that we have received information from or about children under age 13, please contact us through the Privacy Feedback form. Security We take reasonable precautions to protect our site and information automatically collected by WhiteHouse.gov or voluntarily submitted to WhiteHouse.gov or an official White House page on a third-party site. For example, we restrict access to personally identifiable information to employees, contractors, and vendors subject to non-disclosure requirements who require access to this information in order to perform their official duties and exercise controls to limit what data they can view based on the specific needs of their position. Access to official White House accounts on third-party sites is limited to the individuals who administer those accounts, and all official White House accounts are clearly labeled. We also utilize commonly used practices and technical controls to protect the information in our possession or control, along with WhiteHouse.gov itself. These practices and controls include, but are not limited to: encrypting the transfer of personal information over the internet via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), using high-strength firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to safeguard personal information, and maintaining strict technical controls and procedures to ensure the integrity of all data on WhiteHouse.gov. We periodically review our processes and systems to verify compliance with industry best practices and to ensure the highest level of security for our website. Updates to This Privacy Policy We will revise or update this policy from time to time. If we make significant changes to how we handle personal information, we will post changes to the policy on our site and change the date at the bottom. We will provide additional notice in advance (e.g., a disclaimer on our website or an email to subscribers) if material changes are being made. Updated: December 19, 2015 Previous version(s) of this policy may be accessed on the archive page. Glossary Internet Protocol (IP): A computer’s IP address establishes its location on the internet and allows other computers, such as those hosting WhiteHouse.gov, to send it content and other information.

Go back up to the term in use.       When you visit a page on WhiteHouse.gov, the internet browser on your computer may download a small file from WhiteHouse.gov (commonly called a “cookie”) so that our website can recognize your computer when you use WhiteHouse.gov in the future. To learn how to manage or refuse cookies from Whitehouse.gov or any other site see USA.gov. WhiteHouse.gov Cookies WhiteHouse.gov uses the following cookies (defined and organized per the Office of Management and Budget’s “Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies” (OMB M-10-22): Single-session cookies are used for technical purposes, such as enabling better navigation through the site, facilitating the use of user accounts, and generating aggregated statistics about how the website is used. Single-session cookies may use a unique identifier, but do not publicly expose personal information. Under the framework of OMB M-10-22, this qualifies as a Tier 1 use. Multi-session or persistent cookies are used to recognize a computer that has previously visited WhiteHouse.gov, which can improve a user’s experience, for example, by continuing preference settings from previous visits. Under the framework of OMB M-10-22, this qualifies as a Tier 2 use. WhiteHouse.gov currently uses the following cookies: Single-session cookies are used to ensure that WhiteHouse.gov displays correctly on your device. Cookies with the name “has_js” are used to track if a user’s browser has Javascript enabled and cookies with the name “d” are used to track if the website should present in a desktop or mobile format. These cookies do not use a unique identifier. When a visitor views a welcome, or “splash,” page, a persistent cookie prevents them from seeing that page repeatedly. This cookie does not use a unique identifier. These cookies begin with wh_splash. Several persistent cookies measure website metrics on WhiteHouse.gov, such as which pages are popular and how often people visit the website. These have a name that begin with _utm and are unique. These cookies do not capture personally identifiable information, such as your name or email, or track interactions outside of WhiteHouse.gov and other White House sites/pages. This list does not include cookies associated with third-party content or functionality included on WhiteHouse.gov (see Third-Party Cookies). The White House uses a third-party analytics provider (currently Google Analytics) to analyze the data collected through the cookies with a name beginning _utm. The third-party analytics provider does not receive personally identifiable information through these cookies and does not combine, match, or cross-reference WhiteHouse.gov information with any other information. We have also limited the provider’s ability to see your full IP address (a process known as “IP masking”). Please review Google Analytics’s privacy policy for additional information. Cookies for Email Subscribers In order to improve email subscribers’ experience and the overall quality of our services, we may use cookies to measure the effectiveness of our email communications and to better tailor email content. Specifically, we may connect the data showing that an email subscriber clicked a link in an email to a subsequent action taken by that individual on the White House website, such as completing a webform. Because this links cookie data with an individual user, this would qualify as a Tier 3 use under the framework of OMB M-10-22. We would therefore only connect cookie data to individual users who have consented and opted in to receiving emails. We would also dispose of such cookie data after 13 months. For data captured in this manner, we would restrict access to individual-level information to employees, contractors, and vendors subject to non-disclosure requirements who require access to this information in order to perform their official duties and exercise controls to limit what data they can view based on the specific needs of their position. Third-Party Cookies Some pages on WhiteHouse.gov may include web content or functionality from third parties, such as embedded videos hosted by non-WhiteHouse.gov services. For example, as of April 18, 2014, content or functionality from the following third parties may be present on some WhiteHouse.gov pages: YouTube.com Vimeo.com Flickr.com Socrata.com Google Moderator Livestream.com UStream.com MapBox.com SlideShare.com Scribd.com SoundCloud.com Storify.com Twitter.com Instagram.com Pinterest.com Facebook.com Thunderclap.it AddThis.com Plus.Google.com   If you would like to receive content that is posted using one of these third-party providers without utilizing the third-party provider, please contact us at WhiteHouse.gov/Tech/Feedback. These third parties may use web measurement and customization technologies (such as cookies) in conjunction with the provision of this content or functionality. You should consult the privacy policies of these third parties for further information. We do not knowingly use third-party tools that place a multi-session cookie prior to the user interacting with the tool, for example by playing an embedded video. If you become aware of a third-party tool on WhiteHouse.gov that places a multi-session cookie prior to any user interaction, please contact us at WhiteHouse.gov/Privacy/Feedback. How to Manage Cookies Visitors can control aspects of website measurement and customization technologies used on WhiteHouse.gov and still have access to comparable information and services on WhiteHouse.gov. You can choose not to accept cookies from any website, including WhiteHouse.gov, by changing the settings of your browser. You can also delete cookies stored in your browser at any time.

Transcript: My fellow Americans, We have taken major steps during the first few weeks of my Administration to remove wasteful regulations and get our people back to work. I have been saying I was going to do that for a long time. This week I signed two pieces of legislation to remove burdens on our economy, continue to keep my promises to the American People and so much more. I signed House Joint Resolution 38, which eliminates an anti-coal regulation put forward by unelected bureaucrats.  Our coal miners have been treated horribly, and we are going to turn that around - and we are going to turn it around quickly. We are going to fight for lower energy prices for all Americans as part of the deal. That’s why I also signed a resolution to eliminate a costly regulation Dodd-Frank imposed on American energy companies. By stopping this regulation, we are able to save American companies and workers millions and millions of dollars in job-killing compliance costs. But to truly succeed as a country, we must realize the full potential of women in our economy. That is why I was thrilled to host the White House’s women’s business leaders roundtable—very exciting, great women. As President, I am committed to ensuring that women entrepreneurs have equal access to the capital, markets, and networks of support that they need, and I mean really need. And it’s going to happen.  This is a priority for my Administration.  I campaigned on helping women in the workforce, and we are going to deliver on that promise, believe me. In fact, as part of my first official meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week, we announced the creation of the joint United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. Actually, very exciting. The United States also reaffirmed our unbreakable bond this week with our cherished ally, Israel. It was an honor to welcome my friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. I affirmed to the Prime Minister America’s commitment to working with Israel and our allies and partners toward greater security and stability.  The threat of terrorism—and believe me it is a threat—must be confronted and defeated and we will defeat it. We share with Israel a deep conviction that we must protect all innocent human life. So as you head into the President’s Day weekend, the American people should know that we are working tirelessly on your behalf.  We are not here for the benefit of bureaucrats, consultants, or pundits—we are here to work for you, and only for you, the American people. Thank you, God Bless you and God Bless America.

Term ""Fiduciary""; Conflict of Interest Rule Retirement Investment Advice, 81 Fed. Reg. 20946 (April 8, 2016) (Fiduciary Duty Rule or Rule), may significantly alter the manner in which Americans can receive financial advice, and may not be consistent with the policies of my Administration. Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following: Section 1. Department of Labor Review of Fiduciary Duty Rule. (a) You are directed to examine the Fiduciary Duty Rule to determine whether it may adversely affect the ability of Americans to gain access to retirement information and financial advice. As part of this examination, you shall prepare an updated economic and legal analysis concerning the likely impact of the Fiduciary Duty Rule, which shall consider, among other things, the following: (i) Whether the anticipated applicability of the Fiduciary Duty Rule has harmed or is likely to harm investors due to a reduction of Americans' access to certain retirement savings offerings, retirement product structures, retirement savings information, or related financial advice; (ii) Whether the anticipated applicability of the Fiduciary Duty Rule has resulted in dislocations or disruptions within the retirement services industry that may adversely affect investors or retirees; and (iii) Whether the Fiduciary Duty Rule is likely to cause an increase in litigation, and an increase in the prices that investors and retirees must pay to gain access to retirement services. (b) If you make an affirmative determination as to any of the considerations identified in subsection (a) or if you conclude for any other reason after appropriate review that the Fiduciary Duty Rule is inconsistent with the priority identified earlier in this memorandum then you shall publish for notice and comment a proposed rule rescinding or revising the Rule, as appropriate and as consistent with law. Sec. 2. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. (d) You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. DONALD J.

An avid Chinese linguist and geology scholar, she was also the first First Lady to make regular nationwide radio broadcasts. Admirably equipped to preside at the White House, Lou Henry Hoover brought to it long experience as wife of a man eminent in public affairs at home and abroad. She had shared his interests since they met in a geology lab at Leland Stanford University. She was a freshman, he a senior, and he was fascinated, as he declared later, ""by her whimsical mind, her blue eyes and a broad grinnish smile."" Born in Iowa, in 1874, she grew up there for ten years. Then her father, Charles D. Henry, decided that the climate of southern California would favor the health of his wife, Florence. He took his daughter on camping trips in the hills--her greatest pleasures in her early teens. Lou became a fine horsewoman; she hunted, and preserved specimens with the skill of a taxidermist; she developed an enthusiasm for rocks, minerals, and mining. She entered Stanford in 1894--""slim and supple as a reed,"" a classmate recalled, with a ""wealth of brown hair""--and completed her course before marrying Herbert Hoover in 1899. The newlyweds left at once for China, where he won quick recognition as a mining engineer. His career took them about the globe--Ceylon, Burma, Siberia, Australia, Egypt, Japan, Europe--while her talent for homemaking eased their time in a dozen foreign lands. Two sons, Herbert and Allan, were born during this adventurous life, which made their father a youthful millionaire. During World War I, while Hoover earned world fame administering emergency relief programs, she was often with him but spent some time with the boys in California. In 1919 she saw construction begin for a long-planned home in Palo Alto. In 1921, however, his appointment as Secretary of Commerce took the family to Washington. There she spent eight years busy with the social duties of a Cabinet wife and an active participation in the Girl Scout movement, including service as its president. The Hoovers moved into the White House in 1929, and the First Lady welcomed visitors with poise and dignity throughout the administration. However, when the first day of 1933 dawned, Mr. and Mrs. Hoover were away on holiday. Their absence ended the New Year's Day tradition of the public being greeted personally by the President at a reception in the Executive Mansion. Mrs. Hoover paid with her own money the cost of reproducing furniture owned by Monroe for a period sitting room in the White House. She also restored Lincoln's study for her husband's use. She dressed handsomely; she ""never fitted more perfectly into the White House picture than in her formal evening gown,"" remarked one secretary. The Hoovers entertained elegantly, using their own private funds for social events while the country suffered worsening economic depression. In 1933 they retired to Palo Alto, but maintained an apartment in New York. Mr. Hoover learned the full lavishness of his wife's charities only after her death there on January 7, 1944; she had helped the education, he said, ""of a multitude of boys and girls."" In retrospect he stated her ideal for the position she had held: ""a symbol of everything wholesome in American life.""

Clinton Bill Clinton is an American politician from Arkansas who served as the 42nd President of the United States (1993-2001). He took office at the end of the Cold War, and was the first baby-boomer generation President.  During the administration of William Jefferson Clinton, the U.S. enjoyed more peace and economic well being than at any time in its history. He was the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second term. He could point to the lowest unemployment rate in modern times, the lowest inflation in 30 years, the highest home ownership in the country's history, dropping crime rates in many places, and reduced welfare rolls. He proposed the first balanced budget in decades and achieved a budget surplus. As part of a plan to celebrate the millennium in 2000, Clinton called for a great national initiative to end racial discrimination. After the failure in his second year of a huge program of health care reform, Clinton shifted emphasis, declaring ""the era of big government is over."" He sought legislation to upgrade education, to protect jobs of parents who must care for sick children, to restrict handgun sales, and to strengthen environmental rules. President Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas, three months after his father died in a traffic accident. When he was four years old, his mother wed Roger Clinton, of Hot Springs, Arkansas. In high school, he took the family name. He excelled as a student and as a saxophone player and once considered becoming a professional musician. As a delegate to Boys Nation while in high school, he met President John Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden. The encounter led him to enter a life of public service. Clinton was graduated from Georgetown University and in 1968 won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University. He received a law degree from Yale University in 1973, and entered politics in Arkansas. He was defeated in his campaign for Congress in Arkansas's Third District in 1974. The next year he married Hillary Rodham, a graduate of Wellesley College and Yale Law School. In 1980, Chelsea, their only child, was born. Clinton was elected Arkansas Attorney General in 1976, and won the governorship in 1978. After losing a bid for a second term, he regained the office four years later, and served until he defeated incumbent George Bush and third party candidate Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential race. Clinton and his running mate, Tennessee's Senator Albert Gore Jr., then 44, represented a new generation in American political leadership. For the first time in 12 years both the White House and Congress were held by the same party. But that political edge was brief; the Republicans won both houses of Congress in 1994. In 1998, as a result of issues surrounding personal indiscretions with a young woman White House intern, Clinton was the second U.S. president to be impeached by the House of Representatives. He was tried in the Senate and found not guilty of the charges brought against him. He apologized to the nation for his actions and continued to have unprecedented popular approval ratings for his job as president. In the world, he successfully dispatched peace keeping forces to war-torn Bosnia and bombed Iraq when Saddam Hussein stopped United Nations inspections for evidence of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. He became a global proponent for an expanded NATO, more open international trade, and a worldwide campaign against drug trafficking. He drew huge crowds when he traveled through South America, Europe, Russia, Africa, and China, advocating U.S. style freedom.

Continuing his work as a lifelong public service, Clinton created the Clinton Foundation in 2001 to improve global health, education, economies and environments. Affectionately calling him “Do-Gooder-in-Chief”, President Obama has worked with Clinton to make buildings in our country more efficient—announcing a $4 billion investment in energy efficiency upgrades for commercial buildings. In 2009, former President Clinton partnered with 43rd President Bush to help rebuild Haiti, after the country was devastated by an earthquake.

She was an avid supporter of charitable causes and volunteerism. Born Thelma Catherine Ryan on March 16 in Ely, Nevada, ""Pat"" Nixon acquired her nickname within hours. Her father, William Ryan, called her his ""St. Patrick's babe in the morn"" when he came home from the mines before dawn. Soon the family moved to California and settled on a small truck farm near Los Angeles--a life of hard work with few luxuries. Her mother, Kate Halberstadt Bender Ryan, died in 1925; at 13 Pat assumed all the household duties for her father and two older brothers. At 18, she lost her father after nursing him through months of illness. Left on her own and determined to continue her education, she worked her way through the University of Southern California. She held part-time jobs on campus, as a sales clerk in a fashionable department store, and as an extra in the movies--and she graduated cum laude in 1937. She accepted a position as a high-school teacher in Whittier; and there she met Richard Nixon, who had come home from Duke University Law School to establish a practice. They became acquainted at a Little Theater group when they were cast in the same play, and were married on June 21, 1940. During World War II, she worked as a government economist while he served in the Navy. She campaigned at his side in 1946 when he entered politics, running successfully for Congress, and afterward. Within six years she saw him elected to the House, the Senate, and the Vice Presidency on the ticket with Dwight D. Eisenhower. Despite the demands of official life, the Nixons were devoted parents to their two daughters, Tricia (now Mrs. Edward Cox), and Julie (now Mrs. David Eisenhower). A tireless campaigner when he ran unsuccessfully for President in 1960, she was at his side when he ran again in 1968--and won. She had once remarked succinctly, ""It takes heart to be in political life."" Pat Nixon used her position as First Lady to encourage volunteer service--""the spirit of people helping people."" She invited hundreds of families to nondenominational Sunday services in the East Room. She instituted a series of performances by artists in varied American traditions--from opera to bluegrass. Mrs. Nixon took quiet pride in adding 600 paintings and antiques to the White House Collection. She had shared her husband's journeys abroad in his Vice Presidential years, and she continued the practice during his Presidency. Her travels included the historic visit to the People's Republic of China and the summit meetings in the Soviet Union. Her first solo trip was a journey of compassion to take relief supplies to earthquake victims in Peru. Later she visited Africa and South America with the unique diplomatic standing of Personal Representative of the President. Always she was a charming envoy. Mrs. Nixon met the troubled days of Watergate with dignity. ""I love my husband,"" she said, ""I believe in him, and I am proud of his accomplishments."" She died at home in Park Ridge, New Jersey, on June 22, 1993. Her husband followed her in death ten months later. She and the former President are buried at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, California.

Brady Press Briefing Room  1:43 P.M. EST MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everybody.  Thanks for coming.   Last night, the President was honored to announce Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to serve as the next justice to the Supreme Court.  It was an unbelievably phenomenal evening. Immediately after being announced, Judge Gorsuch was honored to meet with Maureen and Father Scalia.  As some of you have reported, his first call after coming back behind the podium was to Merrick Garland, who I would also note has already come out to say that Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair hearing. In less than 24 hours, Judge Gorsuch has already received widespread praise from across the political spectrum as an inspired choice, with sterling academic credentials, a brilliant legal mind, and a steadfast commitment to constitutional principles.  During his long career in public service, Judge Gorsuch has enjoyed bipartisan approval, having previously been confirmed by a voice vote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. In fact, 12 current Democratic senators -- including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Leahy -- were all in office when he was first confirmed without opposition in 2006.  With as many as eight Democrats, like Senators Blumenthal, Durbin, McCaskill, already supporting a full hearing and vote for Judge Gorsuch, there is no question that he is a widely respected jurist who deserves to have his nomination fairly decided upon by the United States Senate. Now that Judge Gorsuch has been officially named, I hope you all allow me to talk for a moment about how exceptionally qualified he is to succeed the late, great Antonin Scalia. Judge Gorsuch’s academic record is impeccable, and as he said last night, the President holds education in the highest regard. Judge Gorsuch graduated Phi Kappa Beta [sic] from Columbia, graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School, and attended Oxford as a recipient of the prestigious Marshall Scholarship. Like Justice Scalia, the cornerstone of Judge Gorsuch’s judicial philosophy is fidelity to the text.  He believes that judges should base their decisions solely on the law and the -- he believes -- sorry, I almost screwed that one up -- (laughter) -- he believes his decision should be based solely on the law and the Constitution, not on their own policy preferences or personal feelings.  He will be a reliable and principled voice on the bench, preserving equal justice under the law, regardless of background. And I would note, I think -- and I always want to caveat this -- but to my understanding, I think he would be the first justice that will serve with the -- as someone he clerked for on the bench.  So it will be a sort of first when he is confirmed by the Senate.  Now, on to the issues of the day.  Today is February 1st, which means we are kicking off Black History Month.  The President has events planned throughout the month, starting today with a listening session that occurred earlier this morning with African American leaders in the Roosevelt Room.  The meeting also included some of the administration’s African American appointees. Later today, the President will issue a proclamation.  The U.S. Postal Service kicked off the month by issuing the Dorothy Height Forever stamp, the 40th stamp in their Black Heritage series.  Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and the Congressional Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush in 2004 -- excuse me, 1994 and 2004.  President Obama delivered her eulogy in 2010, and President Trump is now proud that the Post Office is honoring her incredible legacy as a civil rights icon. At events throughout this entire month, we'll celebrate the contributions of courageous African American leaders -- from Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Clarence Thomas.  African American history is American history, and this month is a great reminder of that. Continuing with today’s schedule, the Vice President went to the Hill with Judge Gorsuch to meet with lawmakers for the first time since being named last night.  On the Hill, the Vice President met with Majority Leader McConnell.  And the staff spearheading Judge Gorsuch’s nomination will also meet with Senators Cornyn, Grassley, Hatch, and Gardner. With Judge Gorsuch on Capitol Hill, I think it's a good time to talk about the confirmation process.  Neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama nominated were subject to the 60-vote threshold of a Senate filibuster.  They received bipartisan support because Republicans, despite some political and philosophical differences, viewed them as mainstream and qualified.  And Judge Gorsuch should receive the same fair treatment. Also this morning, the President met in the Roosevelt Room with representatives of outside groups to discuss Judge Gorsuch’s nomination, including David O'Steen of the National Right to Life; Paula White of the New Destiny Christian Center; Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association; Penny Nance of Concerned Women of America; Charmaine Yoest of American Values; Juanita Duggan of the National Federation of Independent Businesses; Tom Collamore of the United States Chamber of Commerce; Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform; Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society; Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List; and Morton Blackwell of the Leadership Institute. President Trump told the group that his decision on the Supreme Court is among the most important decisions he will ever make as President.  He praised Judge Gorsuch for his academic and professional achievements and his lifelong devotion to the law. The attendees thanked the President for making such an inspired choice and for delivering on what was, for many of them, their number one issue in the campaign.  They committed vocally to supporting Judge Gorsuch throughout the confirmation process and expressed their desire for the Senate to move swiftly to give him a fair hearing and vote.  The meeting closed with the President inviting the group in the Oval Office, which several attendees really enjoyed that honor.  The President then had lunch with Secretary of State designee Tillerson.  Mr. Tillerson’s tenacity, broad experience, and deep understanding of the geopolitics are going to make him an outstanding chief diplomat for the United States, and the President is looking forward to the full vote of the Senate on his nomination.  Later this evening, the President will participate in a standing legislative affairs strategy meeting with his team, who have been working closely with Congress to enact the President’s agenda.  So far, between the Vice President and staff, we've had many productive conversations with members of both parties, in both chambers, on a variety of issues, from trade to the President’s nomination for the Cabinet and now the Supreme Court.  Now, starting this week, our Legislative Affairs team will also conduct extensive outreach on behalf of Judge Gorsuch’s nomination process.  Clearly, this administration has made reaching out to Congress a top priority, but you know where I’m going with that:  Democrats in the Senate continue to use every tool at their disposal to try and get in the way of the President’s attempts to make America great again. Just today, Senate Democrats again refused to even participate in committee votes for Senate [sic]-designees Price and Mnuchin who were moved out of the Finance Committee with zero Democrats present.  Democrats also boycotted EPA Administrator-designee Pruitt’s hearing.  They're doing their constituents and our country a disservice by resorting to these childish tactics.  The President’s Cabinet nominees will be confirmed on the floor of the Senate, once Democrats actually allow them to get a fair vote. In other Cabinet news, Attorney General-designee Senator Jeff Sessions was voted out of committee today.  We look forward to his full vote as the next Attorney General. Additionally, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- designee -- is expected to receive a vote by the full Senate this afternoon.  And finally, Veterans Administration Secretary-designee Dr. David Shulkin will go before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs at 2:30 this afternoon. A few more things before I open it up for questions.  In terms of the schedule tomorrow, the President will attend the National Prayer Breakfast and have lunch with Harley Davidson executives here at the White House.  The President will also meet with Senator Hatch, Senator Wyden, Congressman Neal and Congressman Brady.  Further guidance on all of those meetings will be coming soon. A few personnel announcements.  Today, the President sent the following nominations to the Senate:  Rachel L. Brand, of Iowa, to be Associate Attorney General; Steven Andrew Engel, of D.C., to be Assistant Attorney General; and Rod J. Rosenstein, of Maryland, to be a Deputy Attorney General. On another note, yesterday we talked about recent reporting concerning the President’s executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry.  I wanted to draw your attention to some polls that have come out on that subject.  For all the hysteria around the implementation of this order, the American people as a whole are very supportive of the action that the President is taking.  A new Rasmussen Report polls finds that 57 percent -- which is a clear majority -- of likely U.S. voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen until the government can do a better job of keeping these individuals out who pose a threat. A Reuters poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe that the United States should limit the number of refugees into the country.  And the safety of the American people and the security of the American homeland are the President’s top priorities, and most Americans agree with the steps that he's taking to keep our country safe. Further, today the United Arab Emirates foreign minister voiced his support for the President’s decision to take our national security so seriously.  The foreign minister also added that he believes the restrictions are not based on religion, but on the “structural problems” faced by these nations.   I know that there was a question on Monday regarding Iran’s firing of a missile and attack on a navy vessel.  I’d like to introduce National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn to provide a quick update. GENERAL FLYNN:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Recent Iranian actions involving a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Iran's destabilizing behavior across the entire Middle East. The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.  These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels and threatened United States and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea.   In these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region.  The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran's malign actions, including weapons transfers, support for terrorism and other violations of international norms.  The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East, which places American lives at risk. President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran, the Obama administration as well as the United Nations as being weak and ineffective.  Instead of being thankful to the United States in these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened.  As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.  Thank you. MR. SPICER:  Thanks, General.  We are going to have a background briefing with NSA staff -- NSC staff, rather, today at 4:00 p.m. here in the briefing room.  Further details will be provided on that subject.  So thank you, General, with that. As we start off, I mentioned yesterday I'm pleased that we've expanded the briefing room -- at least virtually.  And so with that, as I begin to take your question, I'm pleased to offer the first-ever Skype seat question in the White House briefing room to Kim Kalunian from WPRI in Rhode Island. Kim. Q    Thank you.  Good afternoon.  Can you hear me okay? MR. SPICER:  We can. Q    Great.  Just this week, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island began calling our capital city a sanctuary city.  As we know, President Trump's executive order says the White House will begin publicizing a weekly list of these municipalities and pledges to withdraw federal grant money from them.  What I'm wondering is, is how soon we can expect to see this list, and how soon should cities like Providence expect to see their federal funding cut? MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Kim.  I think the President's goal in ending sanctuary cities is pretty clear.  We want to, as we mentioned with these other actions, keep America safe.  The goal is to make sure on two fronts.  One, we are doing everything we can to protect American citizens, institutions, and ending sanctuary cities is one of the ways in which we can continue to do that.  Furthermore, the President has been very clear through his executive order that federal funds, paid for by hardworking taxpayers, should not be used to help fund sanctuary cities.   As we continue to implement this executive order and fulfill the pledge that he made, we'll have further updates on how we tend to -- on how that list will come out and when it will come out.  So I look forward to following up on that as well. With that, David Jackson. Q    David isn't here but I'll ask a question.  (Laughter.) MR. SPICER:  Go for it.  (Laughter.) Q    Maybe he's on Skype?  (Laughter.) Q    The President's daily briefing has been renamed the daily intelligence briefing.  Can you tell me how that differs at all from the PDB?  Is the President receiving his intelligence briefing in writing or orally, and who is giving it to him? MR. SPICER:  He did receive an intelligence briefing today.  Congressman -- or Director Pompeo was here.  General Flynn, his national security advisor, his briefer.  So he receives an intelligence briefing and the PBD every day. Q    Is there any sense that we should get out of the renaming of it from the PDB? MR. SPICER:  I think it is a more comprehensive -- again, I think -- we went through this during the transition period, right?  There is a difference between the raw intelligence and the analysis, and I think he is constantly updated by his national security team and other intelligence officials.  But every single day, he does receive the PBD.  And then I think, on top of that, he is receiving intelligence briefings from his team.   Q    But the oral briefing does not necessarily happen every day? MR. SPICER:  Well, I can get back to you on that.  He does get the PBD every day and on a daily basis meets with his intelligence team, yes. Q    Two quick questions. MR. SPICER:  We're not going to do this again. Q    On Black History Month. MR. SPICER:  Yeah. Q    Is President Obama being invited to any of the Black History Month celebrations? MR. SPICER:  Not that I'm aware of.  It's day one.  We just started it off.  We'll have to get back to you on further details.  I think --  Q    And if I may --  MR. SPICER:  We have a lot -- there's a lot of activities, as I mentioned, that the President is going to do to celebrate and honor this month.  And this was just the first day of the month of February. Q    And today he made the comment about Frederick Douglass being recognized more and more.  Do you have any idea what specifically he was referring to? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think there's contribution -- I think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made.  And I think through a lot of the actions and statements that he's going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more. Kristen. Q    Thank you.  Very quickly, can you clarify what was meant by ""we're putting Iran on notice?"" MR. SPICER:  Well, as I mentioned, I think General Flynn and the NSC staff will have a briefing at 4:00 p.m.  They can go forward.  I'm not going to -- I think we wanted to make very clear that we felt as though that -- their actions were both provocative and a violation, and making sure that they understood that we weren't going to sit by and not act on those actions. Q    Are you building the case to -- MR. SPICER:  I'm just -- I'm not going to go any further than that, Kristen. Q    Okay, then let me ask you about -- let me just ask you about the confirmation hearings.  How does the President plan to get Chuck Schumer onboard with his pick for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, when he has referred to him as a ""clown"" and accused him of fake tears? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think those are two things.  I think we're going to -- you look at the support that's already come out.  I think there's eight senators already that have talked about the need to have a vote and his qualifications.  And not just the Senate but I mean you look at the widespread support that came out for Judge Gorsuch last night across the spectrum.  No matter your philosophical view of the Court, I think his qualifications for the Court, his academic background make him an unbelievably highly qualified person. And so it's not just Chuck Schumer; I think the rest of the Senate as he goes up there -- but I think the interesting thing --  Q    Sure --  MR. SPICER:  Hold on, hold on.  I understand that.  And I think Chuck Schumer has shown time and time again through this confirmation process with the Cabinet that he's more interested in politics than actually moving the government along.  And I think that is troubling. I would ask you that -- I think that the question needs to be asked to Chuck Schumer:  Why are you stalling all of these nominees?  Why are you insisting on new requirements that you didn't assume for Sotomayor or Kagan?  I mean, there's a point at which they need to get asked, why are they obstructing government at every step of the way?  There's an element to which they need to be held accountable as well.  They held certain standards in place for their nominees, both for the bench and for the Cabinet.  And the question is, are they going to live up to the same standards that they imposed on Republicans when they had nominees in a Democratic White House. Q    But does the President think that by personally insulting Chuck Schumer that's a way to get --  MR. SPICER:  But again, Kristen, I think the goal is to get -- when -- but again, I would go back.  Chuck Schumer is not innocent in this.  There's a lot of comments that he's made and a lot of accusations that he's thrown out there and a lot of politics that he's played.  At some point, Chuck Schumer needs to be held accountable for his actions and his words.   Blake. Q    Sean, the President today invoked the possibility on the Supreme Court, Sean, of the possibility of going the route of the nuclear option.  If it gets to that point, is the White House comfortable with that path? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think the President made clear his goal today, which is, number one, he believes that Judge Gorsuch is unbelievably qualified and that he will get nominated -- not only confirmed, but done so with a large bipartisan vote.  As I said at the outset, Republicans looked at the qualifications of the two justices that got through in the Obama administration, and while they may not have agreed with their judicial philosophy, definitely agreed that they were qualified on the merits to be confirmed and they did so. I think that we would ask that we be held to the same standard that the Democrats used when they had nominees up.  But I think the President made very clear that the decision is something that we would rather not have to go down, but also that it is ultimately up to Senator McConnell and how he wants to operate this. John Gizzi. Q    Thank you, Sean.  Just one question today.  Leading up to Judge Gorsuch's announcement last night and him coming out after, there were still rumors that Judge Hardiman was going to be nominated and he, in fact, drove to Washington. MR. SPICER:  No, actually, John, he didn't.  That was media -- that was misreporting.  My understanding is that Judge Hardiman never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  So with all due respect, I can't be held accountable for reports that falsely stated that he was here.  He never was at the White House.  My understanding is he had a meeting in eastern Pennsylvania with another judge.  But it was -- and, again, I'm not -- I don't track his whereabouts, but my understanding is he never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania yesterday.  So it was -- we announced when we were going to make this announcement.  I think it was a phenomenal way to introduce Judge Gorsuch to the American people and the United States Senate.  We invited Democratic leaders, Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Unfortunately, none of them showed up.  But it was an opportunity for them and the American people to see an amazing choice that the President made for the bench. Anita. Q    My question, Sean, my question is --  MR. SPICER:  You said one, John. Q    But I didn't ask the question.  My question is simply this:  With the support that he received, the people who called the President, would it be safe to say that Judge Hardiman will be on deck if there is another vacancy soon -- say, Justice Kennedy retiring by the end of the term? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think there's a lot of vacancies that we see at the appellate level and throughout the government.  He's an impressive, impressive jurist.  Obviously the four that really made that final list for the President were unbelievably impressive.  So I don't want to get in front of the President. Hopefully he continues to have the President's support and is someone that the President was unbelievably impressed with.  So we'll have to see what vacancies come down the pipe. Anita. Q    I know you love when we say we have two questions.  I do have two quick questions about something you mentioned at the top.  First, you mentioned the three folks that are being nominated to the Department of Justice.  Why are they being nominated now, before Senator Sessions is there?  Is it because there's a lack of people?  Was he consulted?  Or is it just because of the whole issue this week with the acting attorney general? MR. SPICER:  It's the normal process of getting those -- I've mentioned at a few briefings -- the deputies, the unders, and the actings are in the pipeline.  We announced one the other day for Homeland.  We've got Commerce was previously announced.  And so this is just a continuation of the process to fill --  Q    So would then Senator Sessions -- I mean, in speaking with him --  MR. SPICER:  Of course.  These are people that he is clearly aware of and supportive of, 100 percent. Q    Okay.  And then the second question was, you mentioned tomorrow the meeting with the Harley Davidson executives.  There's reporting that he was supposed to go to Milwaukee tomorrow or he was supposed to.  That was canceled because of the company.  Can you talk about that? MR. SPICER:  I just think -- look, it was easier for the executives to come here, considering the week and all of the activity that's been going on.  And we figured the easiest thing to do was -- again, no decision had been made about or announced as to what we were doing.  We looked at different options and, ultimately, the easiest thing to do in accordance with the President's schedule was to invite them here to Washington to talk about some of the stuff that we've been doing. Q    Are you worried about protesting? MR. SPICER:  We're not concerned.  I think we're not concerned about that.  We're concerned about American jobs, moving this economy forward, and we're excited to welcome them here to Washington to talk about the great work that they do and the many thousands of people that they employ. With that, let me go to the -- we're going to be here a while, guys.  We'll go to the second Skype seat.  Natalie Herbick from Fox 8 in Cleveland, Ohio.   Natalie.  Q    Secretary Spicer, thank you so much for this rare opportunity.  I appreciate it.  And I'm learning the ropes. MR. SPICER:  Natalie, you're coming back.  (Laughter.) Q    And I would like to quickly ask two questions, if I may.  The first one being, President Trump has been quick to take action on several issues he's addressed along the campaign trail.  And with that in mind, he made a stop here in Cleveland and he said that he would like to make cities like ours the economic envy of the world -- a bold statement.  So our viewers would love to know an example, a specific example, as to how he plans to do this sooner than later. MR. SPICER:  That's a great question, Natalie.  I think it's not just Cleveland but it's Detroit and so many of the other cities around the country.  You've heard the President talk about the need to rebuild our inner cities.  We were really impressed with Cleveland this past July -- we went there for the national convention -- the people of Cleveland, their desire and the rebound that the city has taken.  And I think that when you go to -- whether it's a city like Cleveland or Detroit through different tax and regulatory measures, there's a way that we can continue to bring manufacturing back, we can continue to bring jobs back.  And whether it's Harley Davidson or Carrier or Lockheed or Boeing or the GM, Fiat, Ford, these companies, he continues to talk with about how they can bring jobs back, relocate.  I think that was, again, another one of the conversations that he had with the pharmaceutical companies yesterday.  How can they bring jobs back?  How can we ease regulations to do that? So it's about making sure that we have an environment, Natalie, that allows more cities to compete, to grow the manufacturing base, and to recognize the things that we can do, tax-wise and regulatory-wise, to allow that to flourish. Cecilia. Q    Thank you.  And Steve Bannon can be heard on recording saying, ""Islam is a dark religion, not a religion of peace, a religion of submission.""  Does the President share his chief strategist's apparent beliefs on Islam? MR. SPICER:  No, I think the President has been very clear that his number one goal is not to target any one religion but places and areas where we believe that there is an issue.  That's what the executive order was all about the other day -- making sure that areas that we don't feel have the proper mechanisms in place to assure the security -- that when they travel to the United States, that we know that they're coming here for peaceful purposes. The President's number-one goal has always been to focus on the safety of America, not the religion.  He understands that it's not a religious problem, it's a radicalization problem.  There's a big difference between Islam, the religion, and radical Islamic terrorists that come here to seek to do us harm. Q    But nothing about his comment that the President wants to distance himself from or even elaborate on? MR. SPICER:  I just think I made it clear that there's a difference between the President's view. Yeah. Q    Thanks.  There have been multiple reports of people landing Saturday in the U.S. with valid visas who were denied entry and placed on flights back out of the country.  So that's in violation of at least five of these federal judges' orders that came down.  Is the White House working to ensure that those people illegally deported can return to the U.S.?  And are these court orders causing any second thinking about certain aspects of the order? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think that we just -- we issued earlier today some clarification -- an update from the Counsel's Office that clarifies section 3C and 3E that legal permanent residents, LPRs, do not -- that the waiver -- you no longer need a waiver.  Initially, as the program was lifting off, the idea was that they would go through, be granted a waiver of which everyone was issued a waiver coming in. In the sake of efficiency, we have interpreted the guidance to all of these agencies to both the Acting Secretary of State, the Acting Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security that the guidance is -- that all individuals are responsible for the administration implementation of this order -- that that does not apply.  They no longer need a waiver, because if they are a legal permanent resident, they won't need it anymore. Q    Sean? MR. SPICER:  Yeah. Q    On Glass-Steagall, the President during his campaign said that he supported a reestablishing of Glass-Steagall legislation, which would separate the investment banks from the commercial banks.  There's legislation on both the House and the Senate side.  It's in the Republican program.  Mr. Mnuchin when he was queried on the Hill by Senator Cantwell, who is the author of one of the bills, was a little bit more ambiguous on this issue.  And I wish you could say something on where this President stands on this. MR. SPICER:  I think part of the reason that it's -- we've got to get a Treasury Secretary confirmed.  And I think that when we sit here and get asked questions about policy and you go department after department, -- whether it's Treasury, Energy, EPA, HHS, HUD, Education -- the list goes on and on.  And so you ask about issues and where the President's agenda is.  Well, the reason that the President nominated these highly qualified people was to implement his agenda.  And Senate Democrats continue to hold that up.  And I think when you -- you can't -- you're asking us about how we're going to move forward on an agenda, whether it's Glass-Steagall or so many other issues.  And at the same time, the Democrats are holding up the confirmation of these highly qualified people.  Until that occurs, it makes it a heck of a lot harder. Q    But the President -- MR. SPICER:  Major Garrett. Q    -- still supports Glass-Steagall. MR. SPICER:  The President's position is consistent, yes. Q    Sean, a broad topic I'd like you to take on, which is dissent within the administration, and specifically related to the President's lunch with Rex Tillerson today.  More than 1,000 employees at the State Department, Foreign Service officers and others, have signed this dissent-gape.  Is it the President's position that Rex Tillerson, when he's confirmed, should go through the formal process, meet with those people, and have a dialogue as previous Secretaries of State have?   And is it the President's point of view that when there is dissent, it can be rooted in a philosophical disagreement that's not necessarily in defiance of his orders and that there can be a dialogue, and that it can maybe inform him differently about policy? MR. SPICER:  Sure.  I think the President has always -- Q    Because you said a couple days ago they should get out if they -- MR. SPICER:  No, no, no, I think there's a difference.  Just to be clear on this -- every American has a right to speak their mind.  That's one of the amazing beauties of this country.  You have the ability to write what you want through our First Amendment, and people have a right to speak out, and that's not hampered.  The point that I was making then is that if you believe so deeply that the policy is offensive to you, then you have to understand that the job, the way our government works is we elect a President, and that President gets to carry through their agenda that they set out with the American people during the campaign.     And so they have a right to express it.  And I think Secretary Tillerson, for those who have gotten to meet him, has a very open mind and a desire to meet with people and hear ideas, as does the President, as evidenced through what did through the transition, and what he's done since he's become President.  He has met with groups, businesses, associations, Republicans, Democrats, independents, that have been supportive of him, that have not been supportive of him.  And I think that he's going to continue to do that.  So people have a right to speak their mind, but I think there's a difference between expressing dissent and concern, and not implementing a lawful order, as the acting Attorney General did the other night.   But again, I don’t mean to keep coming back to this, but you're asking what we'll do when Rex Tillerson becomes.  And part of the problem right now is I can't fully answer your question because Democrats are holding up and slow-walking this nomination.  So to presuppose what Rex Tillerson is going to do -- you know, again, I just -- it's ironic that we're being asked what these secretaries will do when they get into office, and the Democrats won't let them assume this, when we all know that the votes are there for them. Q    But I'm just talking about a particular process that has historically been (inaudible) in the State Department. MR. SPICER:  I understand that.  And I think -- but again, I think for me to presuppose what Secretary-designee Tillerson is going to do prior to him actually getting sworn in, I don’t -- he probably will, I don’t know.  But it would be irresponsible of me to answer a question about what he's going to do before he actually gets sworn in. Q    Thanks, Sean.  Senate Democrats have been described as ""bitter"" over the manner in which Judge Merrick Garland was treated when he was nominated for the Supreme Court.  Do you feel, does the President feel that that bitterness is well-founded? MR. SPICER:  I don’t know, I'm not a Senate Democrat.  I think they have a right to feel the way they do.  I think we've explained our position, both during last year when this was going on, that we felt as though this was up to the voters to make a decision on.  And as I pointed out yesterday, so many voters made up their mind based on who they believe the candidates would appoint.  Mr. Trump -- then Mr. Trump -- then-candidate Trump, now President Trump was very clear about the type of people that he was going to put forth first in a list of 10 and then in a list of 11 additional ones.  So I think the American people knew clearly where he was going to go.  He followed through on that campaign promise.   And I think that when you look at the number of people who solely based their vote on that, never mind it was -- and then you expand that, it was pretty clear that that was an important factor in the election.  So I understand it, but I also think that's -- we had an election, it was a major issue in that election, and I think that even when you look across the spectrum -- Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative -- Judge Gorsuch has an unbelievable record and is being praised for that record because of that. Q    I want to ask about Friday, and there's been some reporting that there will be a meeting with President Trump and JP Morgan CEO and others.  Can you tell us a little bit more about who else will be there and where things are at on financial reform?  What message does the President have for bankers, specifically, on financial reform?  We've heard so much about Obamacare and tax reform, but it seems like financial reform has sort of fallen by the wayside. MR. SPICER:  Well, I wouldn’t agree with that.  I think that when you look at regulatory reform and tax reform, and all of the steps that he's been taking to help the economy grow and to create jobs, that's right in that wheelhouse.  I hope to have further updates on the schedule for you tomorrow, but I don’t now.   Mara. Q    Thank you, Sean.  I have question about foreign policy, but I wanted to follow up.  You said that LPRs no longer need a waiver, but you didn’t answer the question about what about the people who were put on planes, people who were LPRs but would put on planes back to where they came from.  What happens to them? MR. SPICER:  Well, again, I think then they go through the process.  It depends if they're an LPR; if not, then they go through the application process.  So if they are an LPR, a legal permanent resident, then they are waived, they can come right through. Q    So they can come back again? MR. SPICER:  That's right.  But I don’t know how many cases that applies to.  I know that if they're not a legal permanent resident, then they have to go back.  And that's part of this vetting process. Q    Sean -- Q    Wait, my question is about the fighting in Ukraine and Russia-backed rebels are moving the lines forward.  And I'm wondering if the President feels that Russia is testing him because this is coming so early in his administration before he's had a chance to fully assemble his team, and what he plans to do about it. MR. SPICER:  The President has been kept aware of, through his National Security Council and his national security team as a whole, what's been going on in the Ukraine, and we'll have further updates as we go on. Q    During the campaign last January, Donald Trump promised that on his first day in office he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools and on military bases.  When can we expect action on that?  And if so, can you share details of what we should expect? MR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think you've seen that the President has been very active in terms of getting executive orders out and following up on the campaign pledges that he made to the American people last night, being another example of that.  We're going to continue to move through this process, and I think we'll have further updates on where we are with respect to the rest of the EO process.  With that, I want to go to my third Skype seat, Lars Larson of the Lars Larson Show.   Q    Commander Spicer, it's a pleasure.  Thanks for your service to America, and thanks for the opportunity.  I've got a broad question.  The federal government is the biggest landlord in America.  It owns two-thirds of a billion acres of America.  I don’t think the Founders ever envisioned it that way.  Does President Trump want to start returning the people's land to the people?  And in the meantime, for a second question -- since that's in fashion these days -- can he tell the Forest Service to start logging our forests aggressively again to provide jobs for Americans, wealth for the Treasury, and not spend $3.5 billion a year fighting forest fires? MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Lars.  I think the President has been very clear that as part of an overall comprehensive energy solution, that we've got to utilize the resources that we have, that the federal government owns, whether that's the forests or natural resources or minerals that exist above and below the ground, that we have too infrequently looked at our own resources and counted too much on foreign sources of energy. So we're going to continue, as Congressman Zinke goes through the process to head up the Interior Department, and Governor Perry goes through his appointment -- his confirmation process, to get those individuals through, but then working together in areas where they have overlap and also on areas where they will act individually to realize, to look at those natural resources that we have and figure out how to best utilize them to benefit not just our energy, but also economic growth opportunities with that. Daniel Happer (ph) Q    I was wondering about executive orders.  You haven’t really explained why the President is using the executive orders in the manner that he's doing so.  Why not take this extreme vetting to Congress and have a congressional bill?  And why not -- I mean, what is the philosophy behind -- MR. SPICER:  Well, I don’t think it's a binary choice, Daniel.  I don’t think it's ""only do this.""  I think he has talked about -- especially in the area of immigration -- he's been very, very clear that this a huge priority for him.  And I think that he is going to continue to look at this from a holistic aspect.  In other words, visas, visa reform, the wall, our southern border, our northern border -- all of these things that -- you know, vetting.  Those are very, very comprehensive. And those things in which he can do through executive order and action, he will.  Those things that he can do through working with Congress legislatively, he's going to continue to do as well. Toluse from Bloomberg. Q    The President's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro, told The Financial Times yesterday that he believes that the euro is grossly unvalued, and Germany is benefiting from that and that's why we have a huge trade deficit with Germany and with Europe.  Does the President agree with that, that the euro is undervalued?  And if so, does he plan to do anything about it? MR. SPICER:  I think when it comes to currency valuation, I'm not going to get -- I think we've got a Secretary of Treasury that's in the confirmation process.  And once that happens, I think then Secretary Mnuchin will be able to address that, as well.   Q    Sean, Dan Hausle, 7News of Boston.  I'd like to ask you about Kelly Ayotte's role shepherding -- MR. SPICER:  I was hoping you were going to ask about the Patriots.  (Laughter.)  Q    Well, I would like to ask you about that. MR. SPICER:  You'll get a second -- (laughter) -- Q    Okay, I'll get a second.  But can you talk about Kelly Ayotte's role shepherding Justice Gorsuch around Capitol Hill? MR. SPICER:  Sure.  Look, Senator Ayotte is someone who's respected on both sides of the aisle.  She has a lot of great relationships.  She's a former attorney general.  She understands the judicial process very well, but she's also -- I mean, this process is a relationship process by and far.  You're going around introducing a judge, someone who has not generally been exposed to the legislative process, definitely not the congressional process.   Q    Her relationship with President Trump was stranger in the campaign, and kind of -- MR. SPICER:  That's right.  And I think that that goes and shows, as I've mentioned several times both through the transition and early, the President is not holding some kind of test about what degree of support you had for him.  He wants the best and brightest to continue to serve this country in whatever capacity they can.  I think Senator Ayotte very, very helpfully offered up her services.  She's got a lot of relationships on both sides of aisle.  She's got a tremendous amount of experience in this field.  And I think the President thought she was extremely qualified to do this to help shepherd this unbelievably qualified justice through this process. And so she, as well as the team that we've gathered of individuals on staff here, are going to help get Judge Gorsuch through the nomination process.  And I would say, just as a side note, that if you look at the amazing job that has been done by the team during the transition and now to get these amazing individuals through the process, despite all of the hype that continues to go about this individual is going to face this problem, or which is the one person -- each of them have really sailed through this process.  And story after story says Democrats have tried to land a -- take them out and couldn’t land a glove.  They're unbelievably qualified.  They're unbelievably prepared.  And I think that the same process that we followed with this is going to be followed with Judge Gorsuch, and I think we're going to have a very speedy -- Q    As a follow-up -- as an unbiased Rhode Island native, can you offer your Super Bowl pick?  And President Trump has also showed quite an affinity for Tom Brady and -- MR. SPICER:  I will.  I think you know where I come down on that one.   Q    Thanks, Sean.  Senators Murkowski and Collins both say they're going to vote ""no"" on Betsy DeVos's nomination.  That leaves zero votes to spare.  And Vice President Pence would have to cast the tie-breaking vote.  So my questions are, how confident are you that you have all of the other Republican senators locked down?  And what's the level of concern in the White House that her nomination is going to fail? MR. SPICER:  Zero.  I am 100 percent confident she will be the next Secretary of Education.  She is an unbelievably qualified educator and advocate for students, teachers, parents.  I think that the games that are being played with Betsy DeVos are sad.  She is someone who's been a tireless advocate over the last couple decades to really support reforms that benefit children.  And they are going to be the real winners with her as the Secretary of Education. Sarah Murray. Q    In terms of both the two Republican senators who are voting no on Betsy DeVos and the outcry we saw from Republicans on the Hill last week -- earlier this week about how you guys dealt with the travel ban.  First, is there more that the Trump administration and Trump himself should be doing to ensure that his party is on the same page with his priorities?  And secondly, on the Yemen raid, can you give us more of an understanding of was there a discussion about the risks involved in this?  Was it a straightforward decision?  And do you guys still view it to be a success in spite of the death of a Navy SEAL? MR. SPICER:  So first, I would just note, Sarah, that I've heard story after story in the last 40 days about how whether -- going back to the last question about these nominees and not getting through.  Rex Tillerson was going to go down and so-and-so was going to -- and every one of them, after they got to meet with senators of both sides of the party, have shown why the President chose them -- because they were unbelievably qualified, unbelievably ready to lead and enact an agenda of change in the area of responsibility that they're taking over.  And I think the same is going to be true for everyone else who is remaining. Q    But two members of your own party disagree. MR. SPICER:  The vote hasn't taken place.  I think we've had some concerns in the past and I think when these nominees have met with them and shared with them their thoughts throughout the process -- and, again, you can go back, story after story, and again, each one of these folks who I've heard isn't going to make it, is going to go over the finish line each time.  And I think that -- we hear it over and over again and yet we succeed every time.  And yet, another roadblock is put up -- well, this person won't succeed.  And yet, you look at each one of these people going through the process and it's worked beautifully every time.  And I think we're going to continue that path. With respect to Yemen, I think it's hard to ever say something was successful when you lose a life.  But you've got to understand that Chief Owens -- he went back, deployed 12 times, because he loved this country and he believed in the mission.  And knowing that we killed an estimated 14 AQAP members and that we gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil is something that I think most servicemembers understand that that's why they join the service. And so you never want to call something a success, 100 percent, when someone is hurt or killed, and that was the case here, but I think that when you recognize that an individual like this loved this country so much and deployed over and over again because he knew that the mission that he was conducting was so important to our protection, our freedom, our safety.  And I know that when the President spoke to Karen, his wife, and talked about the three children that he left behind, she continued to be impressed with -- to impress upon the President, rather, that while it was an unbelievably sad and emotional time for her and her family, that he loved doing this. And so, again, I don't think you ever call anything 100 percent success, but what he did for this nation and what we got out of that mission, I think I truly believe -- and I know the President believes -- it's going to save American lives. With that, let me go to the last question on Skype and then we'll continue.  Jeff Jobe of South Central Kentucky -- of the Jeff Jobe Publishing in South Central Kentucky. Jeff. Q    Thank you for allowing me to be part of today's White House press briefing.  Clearly, anyone paying attention will see that President Trump is aggressively acting on his campaign promises.  This in itself gives hope to my state and particularly the region in which I grew up, Appalachia.  We've seen countless politicians make promises at both state and national levels, and not only forget us, but to turn on us.  So my question is, how soon or when will the roles restricting coal mining, coal burning and coal exports be reversed? MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Jeff.  I've talked about this a couple times so far, but I believe -- or the President has very clearly stated that clean coal in particular is an issue that's so important to our energy independence as well as our job creation in this country.  And so whether you're talking about Kentucky or West Virginia or Pennsylvania, or so many other places in this country that rely on coal, bringing the production of clean coal back is good for our energy independence, is good for our economy, is good for job creation, and is something that he continues to talk about.  And I think once we have the Secretary of Energy confirmed, that we can continue to take steps to move forward with.    Q    Two questions for you.  After the primetime announcement last night, it seems like the numbers were good.  Do you have a sense that this President will be more aggressive than his predecessors on seeking primetime air play for his announcements?  And two, top Democrats are asking the Defense Department to investigate Michael Flynn's possible violation of the Constitution.  Do you have a -- it sounds like you saw that story.  Do you have a response to that? MR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think on the air time issue, that's something that we're not particularly suffering from when it comes to attention.  And I think the President does a phenomenal job of getting attention and getting his message out.  His use of social media in particular that when you look at the number of people -- I think we had something like 11 million people watching the address on Facebook Live last night.  Obviously if we have important issues to discuss with the nation, or announcements to make or nominations, then we'll request time.  I don’t think that that's something that we've spent a ton of time figuring out.  I think we're doing pretty well on that front. And then, I'm sorry, the second question, Mike? Q    The request from Democrats to investigate Flynn for a possible violation of the Emoluments Clause. MR. SPICER:  Yeah, so General Flynn, like I think probably countless, if not hundreds, of retired flag officers joins his speaking bureau, and has given speeches at various places.  And I think that is something that is kept in practice.  And the Department of Defense is the appropriate place for them to review it.  But as I said, I think that when you look at so many countless retired flag officers, that's something that generally keeps (inaudible). Zeke. Q    Thanks, Sean.  General Flynn, when he was up here, offered some criticism about the Obama administration's handling of Iran in particular.  Is that something we should be expecting to hear more from this administration, whether it be on foreign policy or other issues -- criticism of the previous administration going forward? MR. SPICER:  I think in area where there's going to be a sharp difference, in particular national security, in contrasting the policies that this President is seeking to make the country safer, stronger, more prosperous, he's going to draw those distinctions and contrast out.  But in this particular area, I think the President, when it came to the Iran nuclear deal, was very, very adamant in his opposition to the deal and to its implications.   And so he's going to continue to make sure that the American people know that some of these deals and things that were left by the previous administration, that he wants to make very clear what his position is and his opposition to them.  And the action and the notice that he put Iran on today is something that is important, because I think the American people voted on change.  Again, this is another issue that he was very clear about. So with that, thank you, guys.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Take care.  Have a good day. END  2:32 P.M.

His story is the American story -- values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others. Barack H. Obama is the 44th President of the United States. His story is the American story — values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others. With a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, President Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. He was raised with help from his grandfather, who served in Patton's army, and his grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management at a bank. After working his way through college with the help of scholarships and student loans, President Obama moved to Chicago, where he worked with a group of churches to help rebuild communities devastated by the closure of local steel plants. He went on to attend law school, where he became the first African—American president of the Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he returned to Chicago to help lead a voter registration drive, teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago, and remain active in his community. President Obama's years of public service are based around his unwavering belief in the ability to unite people around a politics of purpose. In the Illinois State Senate, he passed the first major ethics reform in 25 years, cut taxes for working families, and expanded health care for children and their parents. As a United States Senator, he reached across the aisle to pass groundbreaking lobbying reform, lock up the world's most dangerous weapons, and bring transparency to government by putting federal spending online. He was elected the 44th President of the United States on November 4, 2008, and sworn in on January 20, 2009. He and his wife, Michelle, are the proud parents of two daughters, Malia, 14, and Sasha, 11.   Learn more about Barack Obama's spouse, Michelle Obama.

ISIS has engaged in a systematic campaign of persecution and extermination in those territories it enters or controls.  If ISIS is left in power, the threat that it poses will only grow.  We know it has attempted to develop chemical weapons capability.  It continues to radicalize our own citizens, and its attacks against our allies and partners continue to mount.  The United States must take decisive action to defeat ISIS.  Sec. 1.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States that ISIS be defeated. Sec. 2.  Policy Coordination.  Policy coordination, guidance, dispute resolution, and periodic in-progress reviews for the functions and programs described and assigned in this memorandum shall be provided through the interagency process established in National Security Presidential Memorandum – 2 of January 28, 2017 (Organization of the National Security Council and the Homeland Security Council), or any successor. (i)    Development of a new plan to defeat ISIS (the Plan) shall commence immediately. (ii)   Within 30 days, a preliminary draft of the Plan to defeat ISIS shall be submitted to the President by the Secretary of Defense. (iii)  The Plan shall include: (A)  a comprehensive strategy and plans for the defeat of ISIS; (B)  recommended changes to any United States rules of engagement and other United States policy restrictions that exceed the requirements of international law regarding the use of force against ISIS; (C)  public diplomacy, information operations, and cyber strategies to isolate and delegitimize ISIS and its radical Islamist ideology; (D)  identification of new coalition partners in the fight against ISIS and policies to empower coalition partners to fight ISIS and its affiliates; (E)  mechanisms to cut off or seize ISIS's financial support, including financial transfers, money laundering, oil revenue, human trafficking, sales of looted art and historical artifacts, and other revenue sources; and (F)  a detailed strategy to robustly fund the Plan.      (b)  Participants.  The Secretary of Defense shall develop the Plan in collaboration with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.      (c)  Development of the Plan.  Consistent with applicable law, the Participants identified in subsection (b) of this section shall compile all information in the possession of the Federal Government relevant to the defeat of ISIS and its affiliates.  All executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, promptly comply with any request of the Participants to provide information in their possession or control pertaining to ISIS.  The Participants may seek further information relevant to the Plan from any appropriate source.      (d)  The Secretary of Defense is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register                               DONALD J.

As a result, blue-collar towns and cities have watched their factories close and good-paying jobs move overseas, while Americans face a mounting trade deficit and a devastated manufacturing base. With a lifetime of negotiating experience, the President understands how critical it is to put American workers and businesses first when it comes to trade. With tough and fair agreements, international trade can be used to grow our economy, return millions of jobs to America’s shores, and revitalize our nation’s suffering communities. This strategy starts by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and making certain that any new trade deals are in the interests of American workers. President Trump is committed to renegotiating NAFTA. If our partners refuse a renegotiation that gives American workers a fair deal, then the President will give notice of the United States’ intent to withdraw from NAFTA. In addition to rejecting and reworking failed trade deals, the United States will crack down on those nations that violate trade agreements and harm American workers in the process. The President will direct the Commerce Secretary to identify all trade violations and to use every tool at the federal government’s disposal to end these abuses. To carry out his strategy, the President is appointing the toughest and smartest to his trade team, ensuring that Americans have the best negotiators possible. For too long, trade deals have been negotiated by, and for, members of the Washington establishment. President Trump will ensure that on his watch, trade policies will be implemented by and for the people, and will put America first. By fighting for fair but tough trade deals, we can bring jobs back to America’s shores, increase wages, and support U.S. manufacturing.

Johnson In the 1960 campaign, Lyndon B. Johnson was elected Vice President as John F. Kennedy's running mate. On November 22, 1963, when Kennedy was assassinated, Johnson was sworn in as the 36th United States President, with a vision to build ""A Great Society"" for the American people. ""A Great Society"" for the American people and their fellow men elsewhere was the vision of Lyndon B. Johnson. In his first years of office he obtained passage of one of the most extensive legislative programs in the Nation's history. Maintaining collective security, he carried on the rapidly growing struggle to restrain Communist encroachment in Viet Nam. Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, in central Texas, not far from Johnson City, which his family had helped settle. He felt the pinch of rural poverty as he grew up, working his way through Southwest Texas State Teachers College (now known as Texas State University-San Marcos); he learned compassion for the poverty of others when he taught students of Mexican descent. In 1937 he campaigned successfully for the House of Representatives on a New Deal platform, effectively aided by his wife, the former Claudia ""Lady Bird"" Taylor, whom he had married in 1934. During World War II he served briefly in the Navy as a lieutenant commander, winning a Silver Star in the South Pacific. After six terms in the House, Johnson was elected to the Senate in 1948. In 1953, he became the youngest Minority Leader in Senate history, and the following year, when the Democrats won control, Majority Leader. With rare skill he obtained passage of a number of key Eisenhower measures. In the 1960 campaign, Johnson, as John F. Kennedy's running mate, was elected Vice President. On November 22, 1963, when Kennedy was assassinated, Johnson was sworn in as President. First he obtained enactment of the measures President Kennedy had been urging at the time of his death--a new civil rights bill and a tax cut. Next he urged the Nation ""to build a great society, a place where the meaning of man's life matches the marvels of man's labor."" In 1964, Johnson won the Presidency with 61 percent of the vote and had the widest popular margin in American history--more than 15,000,000 votes. The Great Society program became Johnson's agenda for Congress in January 1965: aid to education, attack on disease, Medicare, urban renewal, beautification, conservation, development of depressed regions, a wide-scale fight against poverty, control and prevention of crime and delinquency, removal of obstacles to the right to vote. Congress, at times augmenting or amending, rapidly enacted Johnson's recommendations. Millions of elderly people found succor through the 1965 Medicare amendment to the Social Security Act. Under Johnson, the country made spectacular explorations of space in a program he had championed since its start. When three astronauts successfully orbited the moon in December 1968, Johnson congratulated them: ""You've taken ... all of us, all over the world, into a new era. . . . "" Nevertheless, two overriding crises had been gaining momentum since 1965. Despite the beginning of new antipoverty and anti-discrimination programs, unrest and rioting in black ghettos troubled the Nation. President Johnson steadily exerted his influence against segregation and on behalf of law and order, but there was no early solution. The other crisis arose from Viet Nam. Despite Johnson's efforts to end Communist aggression and achieve a settlement, fighting continued. Controversy over the war had become acute by the end of March 1968, when he limited the bombing of North Viet Nam in order to initiate negotiations. At the same time, he startled the world by withdrawing as a candidate for re-election so that he might devote his full efforts, unimpeded by politics, to the quest for peace. When he left office, peace talks were under way; he did not live to see them successful, but died suddenly of a heart attack at his Texas ranch on January 22, 1973.

One year ago, the President put forward a comprehensive plan in the Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future that outlined the Administration’s all-of-the-above approach to American energy – a strategy aimed at reducing our reliance on foreign oil, saving families and businesses money at the pump, and positioning the United States as the global leader in clean energy. Today, the President received a new progress report, showcasing the Administration’s historic achievements in each of these areas. The accomplishments in this report, which represent the efforts of six Federal agencies, underscore the Administration’s commitment over the past three years to promoting an all-hands-on-deck, all-of-the-above approach to American energy and building a more secure energy future. Report Highlights: Increasing American Energy Independence: A year ago, the President set a bold but achievable goal of reducing oil imports by a third in a little over a decade, relative to where they were when he ran for office.  Thanks to booming U.S. oil and gas production, more efficient cars and trucks, and a world-class refining sector that last year was a net exporter for the first time in sixty years, we have already cut net imports by ten percent – or a million barrels a day – in the last year alone. And with the new fuel economy standards the President announced last year, we are on pace to meet our goal by the end of the decade. Expanding Domestic Oil and Gas Production: Domestic oil and natural gas production has increased every year President Obama has been in office. In 2011, American oil production reached the highest level in nearly a decade and natural gas production reached an all-time high. Setting Historic New Fuel Economy Standards: The Obama Administration has put in place the first-ever fuel economy standards for heavy-duty trucks, and proposed the toughest fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles in U.S. history, requiring an average performance equivalent of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Over time, these new standards will save consumers more than $8,000 in lower fuel costs. Improving Energy Efficiency in 1 Million Homes: Since October 2009, the Department of Energy and the Department of Housing and Urban Development have completed energy upgrades in more than one million homes across the country. For many families, these upgrades save over $400 on their heating and cooling bills in the first year alone. Doubling Renewable Energy Generation: Thanks in part to the Obama Administration’s investment in clean energy – the largest in American history – the United States has nearly doubled renewable energy generation from wind, solar, and geothermal sources since 2008. Developing Advanced, Alternative Fuels: In 2010, President Obama set a goal of breaking ground on at least four commercial scale cellulosic or advanced biorefineries by 2013. That goal has been accomplished, one year ahead of schedule. Together, these projects, and associated demonstration and pilot projectswill produce a combined total of nearly 100 million gallons per year of advanced biofuels capacity. Supporting Cutting-Edge Research: The Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), which the Obama Administration funded for the first-time ever in 2009, has supported more than 120 individual projects aimed at achieving new and transformational energy breakthroughs. Even with this progress, there is much more work to be done. Today, we are experiencing yet another painful reminder of why developing new American energy is so critical to our future. Just like last year, gas prices are climbing across the country – except this time, even earlier. While there are no silver bullets to solve these challenges, the Obama Administration will continue to build on the progress we’ve made over the past three years. Through a sustained, all-of-the-above approach to American energy we’ll work to restore middle class security, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and create an economy that’s built to last.

And both CBO and Medicare estimate that cost increases are slowing. Despite these encouraging trends, there is much more we need to do – both to reduce costs and strengthen the Medicare program for future generations and to improve health care quality so patients get the best care possible. Achieving these goals takes serious work. That’s why the Affordable Care Act is designed to learn from the best health systems and experts in the country to find better ways to improve health care.  Under health reform, we will reward doctors and hospitals that focus on spending time with patients, that better coordinate care, and that improve the quality of care patients are receiving while lowering costs. Health reform also establishes the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). IPAB will be composed of fifteen experts including doctors, consumers and patient advocates who will be recommended by Congressional leaders, nominated by the President, and confirmed by the Senate.  It will recommend policies to Congress to help Medicare provide better care at lower costs.  Congress could pass these or other changes to strengthen Medicare.  Starting in 2015, if Medicare cost growth per beneficiary exceeds a growth rate target, IPAB recommendations would take effect only if Congress fails to act. Today, Congressional Republicans are working to repeal and dismantle the Independent Advisory Board before it even gets started even though experts like former Bush Administration Medicare Official Mark McClellan called for “[strengthening] and [clarifying] the authority and capacity of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB).”  And a coalition of economists including Nobel Prize Winners said “…the Affordable Care Act contains essentially every cost-containment provision policy analysts have considered effective in reducing the rate of medical spending. These provisions include…An Independent Payment Advisory Board with authority to make recommendations to reduce cost growth and improve quality within both Medicare and the health system as a whole” At the same time, House Republicans passed a plan for Medicare last year that does nothing to reduce overall health care costs.  Instead, the Republican plan shifts costs to seniors and empowers insurance companies. Below is a table on how the Republican plan and IPAB compare. Rather than revisiting the past and trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Congress should work on strengthening Medicare and creating jobs.   Republican Medicare Plan IPAB Ration Care? Yes. Under the Republican plan, nothing would prevent private insurance companies from rationing care. No. IPAB is legally prohibited from making recommendations that would ration health care.      Increase premiums and cost sharing? Yes. Under the Republican plan, administrative costs and health care prices would rise, and seniors would pay about $6,400 more per year for their health care coverage, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).  No. IPAB is legally forbidden from modifying Medicare premiums or cost sharing. Control Costs? No. Under the Republican plan, administrative costs and health care prices would rise according to the CBO.   Yes. IPAB would lower Medicare costs, premiums, and cost sharing according to CBO.  Former CBO Director Robert Reischauer called IPAB a “big deal” that “could generate substantial savings.” Hundreds of prominent economists, including three Nobel Laureates, agree that IPAB is an important component of the Affordable Care Act that will slow health care cost growth. Who is in Charge? Insurance companies. The Republican plan ends Medicare as we know it and repeals the Affordable Care Act, giving free rein to insurance companies to decide what care you get and when, with no clear limits to protect consumers or prevent insurance companies from taking in exorbitant profits. You and your doctor. IPAB strengthens traditional Medicare, making it sustainable for doctors, patients and taxpayers.  Protects Your Guaranteed Medicare Benefits? No.  The Republican plan would eliminate Medicare’s guaranteed benefits and limits on cost sharing and premiums. Instead, insurance companies would determine which benefits seniors on Medicare would receive and how much they pay. Yes.  IPAB is legally prohibited from cutting benefits or increasing premiums and co-payments.  And it builds on the health law’s coverage of preventive benefits and closing of the drug donut hole.      Nancy-Ann DeParle Former Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy The Final State of the Union Watch President Obama's final State of the Union address.

EST THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you for being here.  Nothing like having meetings in the White House.  Good place.  Good place for meetings.  Good place for a lot of things.  People don’t realize I inherited a mess.  A big mess.  I think they know.  I think they understand.   Well, thank you all.  I know so many of you through reading and through business magazines, and you've done an amazing job.  And I want to congratulate you.  I know you're under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers.  I've been hearing that a little bit.  At the same time, we want to make life good for them also.  They come with big investments -- in many cases, those investments are made by their governments.  But they are still big investments. I'm thrilled to welcome the leaders of the airline industry to the White House.  Your industry supports over 10 million well-paying U.S. jobs and creates almost $1 trillion in economic activity, which is really big stuff, really amazing.   Last year, our airlines moved approximately 2 million people each day in our country, which is an incredible number of people.  And they move them well -- despite the bad equipment that the airports give you in many cases, because they can't get approvals, and we had regulatory morass that's a disaster. And I can tell you that a lot of the new equipment that already is obsolete the day they order it -- and that's according to people that know, including my pilot.  I have a pilot who's a real expert, and he said, sir, the equipment they're putting on is just the wrong stuff.  And we'll talk about that.  Because if we're going to modernize our systems, we should be using the right equipment.  And I know Mr. Tilden is nodding.  You know what I mean.  It's one thing to order equipment, but let's order the right equipment.  Probably the wrong equipment costs more.  You can probably buy the right equipment for less money.  So we want to talk about that.  Because my pilot, he's a smart guy, and knows what's going on.  He said the government is using the wrong equipment and instituting a massive, multibillion-dollar project, but they're using the wrong type of equipment.  So let's find out about that. We want the traveling public to have the greatest customer service, with an absolute minimum of delays and with great convenience all at the lowest possible cost.  We want to help you realize these goals, and we will indeed help you realize these goals.  Airports are very important when you travel.  Very important.   As an example, some of you were saying yesterday to me that you go to China, you go to Japan, they have fast trains all over the place.  We don’t have one.  I don’t want to compete with your business -- (laughter) -- but we don’t have one fast train.  And it's the same thing with our airports.  Our airports used to be the best.  Now they're at the bottom of the rung.  We've spent $6 trillion -- think of it -- as of about two months ago, $6 trillion in the Middle East.  We've got nothing.  We've got nothing.  We never even kept just even a little tiny oil well.  Not one little one.  I said, keep the oil.  But we've spent right now $6 trillion in the Middle East.  We have nothing.  And we have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports, we have obsolete trains.  We have bad roads.  We're going to change all of that, folks.  You're going to be so happy with Trump.  I think you already are. So we want to help you realize these goals by rolling back burdensome regulations.  And you people are regulated probably as much as almost anybody, although I can think of a couple of industries that are even worse.  Lowering the overall tax burden on American businesses big league.  That's coming along very well.  Way ahead of schedule, I believe.  And we're going to be announcing something, I would say, over the next two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax, and developing our aviation infrastructure.     Again, I want to thank you all for being here.  So I want this to be a meeting of substance.  I want to be able to do things for you.  The auto industry was in.  They left, they said it was the best meeting they've ever had.  I even took them into the Oval Office.  The head of Ford, the head of General Motors, the head of Fiat, others -- they never saw the Oval Office.  I said, you mean they never took you in?  You see how far away it was from the room?  Ten feet.  It was 10 feet across the hallway, but they never got taken in.  I took them in.   The auto companies are going to be making massive investments in Michigan and Ohio, in Pennsylvania, a lot of the places where jobs have left.  So we’re really happy about that.  They’ve been great.  Ford is going to build -- you know they cancelled a big plant in a certain place, I won’t say where -- a $2 billion plant, and they’re building it in the United States and they’re expanding greatly.  General Motors the same thing.  They’ve been great.  They’ve been great.  I think they’ll continue to be great. But we’re also going to be great to them.  We’re going to get rid of a lot of unnecessary regulation, and we’re going to make their life a lot easier.  They’re going to employ a lot more people.  So a lot of businesses are rushing in.  They’re coming in big league. So with that, I thought what I would do is perhaps we’ll start with Mr. Gray.  We’ll go around the room and just quickly just say who you are and who you represent.  The biggest of the airlines are here.   STAFFER:  Thank you, press. THE PRESIDENT:  And you can -- no, stay, stay, stay.  Let them see who’s here.  (Laughter.)  Everyone is so quick to get rid of the press.  I think I am the most open President ever.  (Laughter.)  They want to get rid of the press.  What, you don’t want to see who Mr. Gray is?  (Laughter.)  Maybe I should have started with somebody else.  (Laughter.)  Okay, you can stay.  Yeah, stay.  Stay for a while.  See who’s here, right?  Okay, good. MR. GRAY:  Well, thank you, Mr. President.  I’m Myron Gray, and I represent the United Parcel Service.   MS. EVENS:  I’m Ginger Evens, I’m the Commissioner of Aviation for the city of Chicago. MR. FLYNN:  Mr. President, Bill Flynn with Atlas Air. MR. WIGINGTON:  Rob Wigington, CEO for Nashville Airport Authority. MR. CALIO:  Nick Calio, Airlines for America.  Thank you for having us. MR. BASTIAN:  Mr. President, Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Airlines. THE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Welcome.  Delta is doing well.   MR. BASTIAN:  Doing great, and you know we’ve been neighbors for a long time.   THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  That’s right, good.   MR. BASTIAN:  Hopefully we've been good to you. THE PRESIDENT:  You've been very good.  Thank you.   MR. HAYES:  Mr. President, Robin Hayes, CEO of JetBlue Airways.  (Inaudible.)  THE PRESIDENT:  Good job. MR. BRONCZEK:  Mr. President, Dave Bronczek, FedEx. THE PRESIDENT:  By the way, Fred Smith was here yesterday. MR. BRONCZEK:  Yes, I know. THE PRESIDENT:  He's a great, great guy. MR. KELLY:  Gary Kelly, Southwest Airlines. THE PRESIDENT:  Great job.   MR. TILDEN:  Brad Tilden, Alaska Air Group.  And we’re actually in the process of merging with Virgin America right now. THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, good. MR. FOYE:  Mr. President, Pat Foye, Executive Director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.   THE PRESIDENT:  Great.  We spoke a long time ago. MR. FOYE:  Yes, sir. THE PRESIDENT:  And you did a good job.  MR. FOYE:  Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Appreciate it. MR. POTTER:  Mr. President, Jack Potter, Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.   MR. BURKE:  Mr. President, Kevin Burke.  I’m the President of Airports Council International-North America, which is every airports in the United States and Canada.  Thank you for having us.   THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. MR. VANECEK:  Mr. President, Bill Vanecek.  I'm the Director of Aviation for the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and Niagara Falls International Airport.  I'm also the chairman of Airports Council International-NA. THE PRESIDENT:  Great.   MR. LOPANO:  Mr. President, good morning.  My name is Joe Lopano.  I’m from Tampa International Airport.   MR. MUÑOZ:  Oscar Muñoz with United Airlines.  And Mr. Doug Parker from American couldn’t be here today. THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Thank you. MS. FLINT:  Good morning, Mr. President.  Deborah Flint, the CEO of Los Angeles World Airports.  LAX is the world’s seventh largest airport and the country’s third largest airport. THE PRESIDENT:  We’ll make it number one worldwide.  Let’s make it number one.  (Laughter.)  I didn’t like the number.  What is number one now in terms of service? MS. FLINT:  Atlanta. THE PRESIDENT:  That’s good.  We love the state of Georgia.  I love Georgia -- I tell you that’s for sure.  So that’s good. PARTICIPANT:  Number one in the world. THE PRESIDENT:  So let me ask you -- so what can we do to make your airlines better, to make your balance sheet better, to have you get more jobs and create more jobs, to have you win competition worldwide so you can start doing more business worldwide?  Because I know you have a lot of competition, and a lot of that competition is subsidized by governments, big league.  I’ve heard that complaint from different people in this room.  Probably about one hour after I got elected I was inundated with calls from your industry, and many other industries, because it’s a pretty unfair situation. What can we do?  Give me suggestions that we can make your life easier and that you can employ a lot more people.  MR. KELLY:  Well, Mr. President, I'll lead this off. THE PRESIDENT:  Southwest Airlines.   MR. KELLY:  Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here.  We have never had a meeting like this, certainly in my years at Southwest Airlines.  So we’re very grateful for this opportunity.   THE PRESIDENT:  I want to congratulate you because you have done an amazing job, really amazing job.  You really have.  So congratulations.  Go ahead. MR. KELLY:  I think we’re very well aligned with your philosophy.  We would welcome tax reform.  We would welcome regulatory reform.  And very well aligned on the need for infrastructure investment.   The single biggest opportunity for aviation is to modernize the air traffic control system.  We work very well with our partners in the airports around the table.  I know them all and we serve all of these airports and -- THE PRESIDENT:  You shouldn't know them too well.  (Laughter.)   MR. KELLY:  Well, they’re our landlords.  (Laughter.)  (Inaudible) the only landlord available.  But we have billions of dollars’ worth of airport projects underway around the country to continue to modernize the airports.  We've spent billions of dollars on the air traffic control modernization but it’s not making any meaningful progress. THE PRESIDENT:  I hear that.  I hear we have the wrong system.  I’m hearing that the United States government -- and is the gentleman who’s the head of the FAA right now not a pilot?  Or is that -- does he -- MR. KELLY:  I don’t know if he’s a pilot or not. THE PRESIDENT:  I’d like to find out because I think it maybe would be good to have a pilot, like a really good pilot who knows what’s going on.  I’ve heard that, and, I don't know, it seems a little hard to believe because the complexity of your business is right up there, right? MR. KELLY:  Oh, very much so. THE PRESIDENT:  And I would think you need a very sophisticated person in that job, and somebody that, frankly -- being a pilot would be helpful, because I’m hearing you put the wrong -- I hear the government contracted this system that’s the wrong system, and I hear that from pilots.  So who would be better to tell me?  But I hear we’re spending billions and billions of dollars.  It’s a system that’s totally out of whack.  It’s way over budget, it’s way beyond schedule, and when it’s completed, it’s not going to be a good system.  Other than that, it’s okay.  (Laughter.)  So what do you think about that, Gary? MR. KELLY:  Well, I agree with you.  When you have a project that takes that long, it becomes outdated. THE PRESIDENT:  It’s already outdated. MR. KELLY:  It’s already outdated, no question.  And we spent billions of dollars on this. THE PRESIDENT:  Has that been you or the government or both? PARTICIPANT:  Oh no, this is the federal -- FAA, air traffic control -- THE PRESIDENT:  So when you say “we” -- “we” the government -- MR. KELLY:  You’re paying for it.  You’re ultimately -- the airlines and our customers are paying for it. THE PRESIDENT:  Why do the airlines allow that to happen where they put in a bad system?  Not even antiquated -- and it’s antiquated because it’s taken so long.  Why do the airlines allow a system that you know is bad from the beginning -- because you guys are pros -- why do they allow the government to put in the wrong system? MR. KELLY:  Well, we’re not in control.  And I think that’s one of the things that we see as the path to having success, is we need to address the fundamental organization of the air traffic organization, not the safety and regulatory oversight -- that’s a government function that needs to remain.  But we believe that reforming the FAA by creating a non-for-profit corporation is the way to address the governments that you’re speaking to, as well as the long-term financing. THE PRESIDENT:  Headed by the airlines?  Headed by who?  The board would be who? MR. KELLY:  The board would be represented by all the various constituents.  So the government would have a seat, general aviation would have a seat, certainly the commercial airlines would have a seat.  Everyone would -- THE PRESIDENT:  Well, this wouldn’t have happened then.  You wouldn’t be putting in a system -- a control system -- that is obsolete before they even signed the contract.  And, by the way, overly expensive.  More expensive than (inaudible).   MR. KELLY:  You know, the interesting thing is I think that there is absolutely unanimous agreement that the system needs to be modernized and that it is well behind schedule.  There is not agreement on the path forward to address that, and that’s where we run into roadblocks.  We want the government out of managing the air traffic control system so that it can be adequately managed, adequately financed, and we can get this done.  We won World War II in three-and-a-half years; we ought to be able to modernize air traffic control. THE PRESIDENT:  So how long would it take to -- because I’m hearing you have to scrap all of the billions of dollars that have been put in -- stupidly put in.  How long would it take to come up with a great air traffic control system, the top anywhere in the world, the top of the line?  How long would that take to do and how much would it cost? MR. KELLY:  The good news is, we don’t have to scrap everything.  We are still using fundamentally World War II-era ground-based radar to guide the aircraft from a navigation standpoint.  We are not utilizing GPS satellite-delivered navigational tools.  Those things exist.  At least for Southwest Airlines, we have fully equipped all of our fleet to take advantage of that, but we’re not getting those kinds of flight profiles written for each airport or each route. THE PRESIDENT:  So you'd save a lot of time, you'd save a tremendous amount of fuel. MR. KELLY:  We think that we're losing $25 billion a year as an industry.  And I think the best example we can offer up to you -- the system is very safe, by the way.  And our air traffic controllers are very fine men and women, and they do a fantastic job.  THE PRESIDENT:  It's safe but it's very cautious.  And it should be cautious. MR. KELLY:  Yes, it must be cautious. THE PRESIDENT:  But I notice the intervals when planes go out seem very, very long. MR. KELLY:  It used to be a 55-minute trip between Washington and New York, and today it's 80.   PARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, it's not just about fuel -- it's about jobs.  The partnership in New York City did a study that the cost of air traffic control congestion in New York and New Jersey alone is $75 billion over a period ending in 2028.  Those are jobs that haven't been created and jobs that --  THE PRESIDENT:  And what is the reason for that? PARTICIPANT:  It's the antiquated system, one, Mr. President.  It's, two, the fact that New York/New Jersey is the busiest airspace in the world.  And, three, frankly, that other countries, including Canada, have more efficient systems.  Implementation and the funding NextGen is really critical.  And this is not an act of (inaudible) -- this is about jobs. PARTICIPANT:  Sir, you asked why -- your question -- how did we let this happen to some degree. THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah. PARTICIPANT:  I've (inaudible) on telecom and railroads and some (inaudible) industry, and it's unfortunate that every time you go from one industry to the other, the regulatory burden continues or gets worse.  So in this particular case, to be very frank and blunt, and to your point earlier, I think it's become political -- it's a political process, and so it's difficult for us to have control. THE PRESIDENT:  Not anymore it's not political.  We're going to get --  PARTICIPANT:  And you have the appointees that you --   THE PRESIDENT:  -- at a reasonable price.  So not anymore.  Go ahead. PARTICIPANT:  I would take special care in reappointing the (inaudible) on the FAA.  Whether or not it needs to be a pilot or not, I can't opine, but it would be nice to have people that actually have a thorough understanding of the business of aviation. THE PRESIDENT:  Is the head of the FAA a pilot?  Does anybody know?  Somebody should know.   PARTICIPANT:  He's not. THE PRESIDENT:  He's not?  He's not a pilot.  I just think a non-pilot would not know the sophistication of this system, right?  I mean, better to have a pilot -- because my pilot said it's a terrible system that they're installing; that the work they're doing now is a waste of tremendous amounts of money because the system is a bad system.  That's coming from a pilot.   PARTICIPANT:  Mr. President, when you talk about jobs, and you just recently asked about that, what we talked about just recently with the airlines is infrastructure in the sky, which is really antiquated.  But you refer to infrastructure on the ground, the airports. THE PRESIDENT:  Both. PARTICIPANT:  Yeah, and the airports really are becoming antiquated, to your point.  There is a system, there is a charge called a passenger-facility charge, which is a charge that's levied on every ticket.  And it hasn't been increased in 16 years, so it's basically defunded.   THE PRESIDENT:  How much is it? PARTICIPANT:  It's $4.50.  That could be increased by a simple act of Congress, and it's not a U.S. tax.  It's a user fee.  So as a customer uses my airport in Tampa, the airlines collect that fee and they send it back to us in Tampa.  It never comes to Washington and gets approved in the budget. THE PRESIDENT:  The problem is, I don't like raising fees or taxes -- I'll be honest.  I mean, we're spending all this money overseas, we're giving away trillions of dollars to all these countries.  All of the countries that trade with us are ripping us off.  The last thing we have to do is raise the fee.  I understand what you're saying, but $4.50 -- it's a lot when you look at all of the passengers.   If there were other ways of doing this -- because you're only hurting yourself by -- really, eventually, people are going to just stop flying because it's very expensive with all the taxes.  I mean, there are other ways.  We're spending so much money overseas, fighting wars, doing things, and, frankly, making horrible trade deals.  So don't worry about the money.  I'll be able to get the money.  The money -- we're going to change things around.   END  10:07 A.M.

Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Today, President Donald J. Trump welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Oval Office and reaffirmed the special relationship and unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel. The tremendous strength of the United States-Israel relationship is reflected in the close partnership between our governments, and also in the ties that connect the peoples of Israel and the United States. Our deep-rooted political, military, economic, and social ties reflect our shared values, strategic interests, and dynamic economic and trade relationship. In today's meeting, President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed that there will be no daylight between the United States and Israel. The President underscored the United States' unwavering commitment to Israel's security, and that his Administration will safeguard and strengthen the overall security relationship. The President and Prime Minister agreed on the need to counter the threats posed by Iran and its proxies, in addition to countering the so-called ""Islamic State"" and other radical Islamic terrorist groups, so as to create a more secure Middle East to the benefit of all countries. The two leaders agreed that the Iran nuclear deal is a terrible deal for the United States, Israel, and the world. The President assured the Prime Minister that Iran must not, and will not, obtain nuclear weapons capability. The two leaders also discussed the crisis in Syria and other regional issues. The United States and Israel stand together facing a range of challenges, and the two leaders pledged to deepen cooperation to bring greater peace and stability to the Middle East and to protect the United States, Israel, and other nations from the global threat of terrorism. President Trump reiterated his desire for peace throughout the Middle East, and for reaching a comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The President and Prime Minister agreed that peace between Israel and the Palestinians can only be negotiated directly between the two parties, and that the United States will work closely with Israel and the Palestinians to make progress toward that goal. The two leaders discussed the issue of Israeli settlement construction, and agreed to continue those discussions and to work out an approach that is consistent with the goal of advancing peace and security. President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed on their mutual goal of making the United States-Israel relationship even closer as both countries pursue shared interests in the region. The two leaders have directed their respective teams to form joint working groups in the months ahead to dramatically improve bilateral relations in a number of areas, including cyber, intelligence, security, trade, technology, countering the threats posed by Iran and other actors, and promoting Arab-Israeli cooperation, including economic cooperation. A working group will also focus on enabling the growth of the Palestinian economy. It is a new day for the United States-Israel relationship, defined by a responsible approach to the challenges and opportunities our two countries face in the Middle East.

President Barack Obama answers an audience member's question during a Town Hall meeting sponsored by LinkedIn at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, Sept. 26, 2011. (Official White House Photo by Samantha Appleton) Today, President Obama was at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California for a discussion on putting America back to work with members of LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network with more than 120 million users worldwide. LinkedIn members from Gainesville, Florida to Phoenix, Arizona submitted their questions on the economy and jobs for the President to answer during the live Town Hall. LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner kicked off the Town Hall, noting the role of passing the American Jobs Act in putting the country back to work: There's one number you may be less familiar with, and that's 3.2 million, the number of available jobs in this country -- 3.2 million.  We have everything we need to begin to put this country back to work -- the raw materials, the basic building blocks and, perhaps most importantly, the will of a nation.  What we need is the way.  With the American Jobs Act, our President is leading the way. Then he turned it over to President Obama to say a few words before diving into questions: As you mentioned, I put forward a proposal, the American Jobs Act, that would put thousands of teachers back into the classrooms who have been laid off due to downturns in state and local budgets; that would make sure that we are rebuilding our infrastructure -- taking extraordinary numbers of construction workers who have been laid off when the housing bubbles went bust and putting them to work rebuilding our roads and our airports and our schools, and laying broadband lines -- all the things that help us make a success; and also make sure that we’re providing small businesses the kinds of tax incentives that will allow them to hire and allow them to succeed.  During the discussion, the President addressed topics ranging from Social Security and Medicare to strengthening our education system and ways to jumpstart the economy. He also addressed the need to invest in our future and pay for those investments in part by making sure everyone, including the wealthiest among us, is contributing a fair share: If we don’t prepare our people with the skills that they need to compete, we’re going to have problems.  If we don’t make sure that we continue to have the best infrastructure in the world, we’re going to have problems.  If we’re not continuing to invest in basic research, we’re going to have challenges.  If we don’t get our fiscal house in order in a way that is fair and equitable so that everybody feels like they have responsibilities to not only themselves and their family but also the country that’s given them so much opportunity, we’re going to have problems. And so I am extraordinarily confident about America’s long-term future.  But we are going to have to make some decisions about how we move forward.  And what’s striking to me is, when we’re out of Washington and I’m just talking to ordinary folks, I don’t care whether they’re Republicans or Democrats, people are just looking for common sense.  The majority of people agree with the prescriptions I just offered.  The majority of people by a wide margin think we should be rebuilding our infrastructure.  The majority of folks by a wide margin think that we should be investing in education.  The majority of people by a wide margin think we should be investing in science and technology.  And the majority of people think by a wide margin that we should be maintaining programs like Social Security and Medicare to provide a basic safety net.  The majority of people by a significant margin think that the way we should close our deficit is a balance of cutting out those things that we don’t need, but also making sure that we’ve got a tax code that’s fair and everybody is paying their fair share. President Obama concluded by saying, ""that's why your voices are going to be so important."" The President called on those who had joined the conversation to keep making their voices heard: I want to hear from you directly, but I also want your voices heard in the halls of Congress.  I need everybody here to be speaking out on behalf of the things that you care about, and the values that made this country great, and to say to folks who you’ve elected -- say to them, we expect you to act responsibly, and not act in terms of short-term political interest.  Act in terms of what’s going to be good for all of us over the long term.  Watch the full video from the Town Hall, here or use the  links below to jump to the questions you're interested in: [[nid:80761]] What can we do as American citizens to unite ourselves and help the economy? What can you do for senior citizens looking for a job, and what’s going to happen to Social security and Medicare? What are you going to do to lessen the regulations and taxation on small businesses? What programs do you think should be in place for individuals to learn new job skills, be in demand, marketable and eventually get hired? How do you envision the government’s role in integrating networking tools that aid veterans that are leaving the service and getting jobs? “Thank you, Mr. President. I don’t have a job, but that’s because I’ve been lucky enough to live in Silicon Valley for a while and work for a small startup down the street here that did quite well. So I’m unemployed by choice. My question is would you please raise my taxes?” ? First, do you think our public education system and our unemployment rates are related? And second, what, if any, overhaul in education is necessary to get Americans ready for the jobs of tomorrow, rather than the jobs of 20 years ago? What would you be your statement of encouragement for those who are looking for work today?   function advagg_mod_1() { // Count how many times this function is called. advagg_mod_1.count = ++advagg_mod_1.count || 1; try { if (advagg_mod_1.count <= 40) { <!-- /** * This script allows for inter- and intra- page arbitrary video * time index linking and is pretty namespace safe, * keeping everything that needs to be ""global"" in MAK. */ var MAK = MAK || {}; // Logging and debugging functions..

His term saw a restoration of prosperity at home, with the goal of achieving ""peace through strength"" abroad. At the end of his two terms in office, Ronald Reagan viewed with satisfaction the achievements of his innovative program known as the Reagan Revolution, which aimed to reinvigorate the American people and reduce their reliance upon Government. He felt he had fulfilled his campaign pledge of 1980 to restore ""the great, confident roar of American progress and growth and optimism."" On February 6, 1911, Ronald Wilson Reagan was born to Nelle and John Reagan in Tampico, Illinois. He attended high school in nearby Dixon and then worked his way through Eureka College. There, he studied economics and sociology, played on the football team, and acted in school plays. Upon graduation, he became a radio sports announcer. A screen test in 1937 won him a contract in Hollywood. During the next two decades he appeared in 53 films. From his first marriage to actress Jane Wyman, he had two children, Maureen and Michael. Maureen passed away in 2001. In 1952 he married Nancy Davis, who was also an actress, and they had two children, Patricia Ann and Ronald Prescott. As president of the Screen Actors Guild, Reagan became embroiled in disputes over the issue of Communism in the film industry; his political views shifted from liberal to conservative. He toured the country as a television host, becoming a spokesman for conservatism. In 1966 he was elected Governor of California by a margin of a million votes; he was re-elected in 1970. Ronald Reagan won the Republican Presidential nomination in 1980 and chose as his running mate former Texas Congressman and United Nations Ambassador George Bush. Voters troubled by inflation and by the year-long confinement of Americans in Iran swept the Republican ticket into office. Reagan won 489 electoral votes to 49 for President Jimmy Carter. On January 20, 1981, Reagan took office. Only 69 days later he was shot by a would-be assassin, but quickly recovered and returned to duty. His grace and wit during the dangerous incident caused his popularity to soar. Dealing skillfully with Congress, Reagan obtained legislation to stimulate economic growth, curb inflation, increase employment, and strengthen national defense. He embarked upon a course of cutting taxes and Government expenditures, refusing to deviate from it when the strengthening of defense forces led to a large deficit. A renewal of national self-confidence by 1984 helped Reagan and Bush win a second term with an unprecedented number of electoral votes. Their victory turned away Democratic challengers Walter F. Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro. In 1986 Reagan obtained an overhaul of the income tax code, which eliminated many deductions and exempted millions of people with low incomes. At the end of his administration, the Nation was enjoying its longest recorded period of peacetime prosperity without recession or depression. In foreign policy, Reagan sought to achieve ""peace through strength."" During his two terms he increased defense spending 35 percent, but sought to improve relations with the Soviet Union. In dramatic meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, he negotiated a treaty that would eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Reagan declared war against international terrorism, sending American bombers against Libya after evidence came out that Libya was involved in an attack on American soldiers in a West Berlin nightclub. By ordering naval escorts in the Persian Gulf, he maintained the free flow of oil during the Iran-Iraq war. In keeping with the Reagan Doctrine, he gave support to anti-Communist insurgencies in Central America, Asia, and Africa. Overall, the Reagan years saw a restoration of prosperity, and the goal of peace through strength seemed to be within grasp.

Did you know?  President Reagan designated Martin Luther King Jr. Day a national holiday; today the Obama Administration honors this tradition, with the First and Second Families participating in service projects on this day. In a June 28, 1985 speech Reagan called for a fairer tax code, one where a multi-millionaire did not have a lower tax rate than his secretary. Today, President Obama is calling for the same with the Buffett Rule.  Previous President | Next President   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

Flipper Dinner, West Point The United States Military Academy West Point, New York 6:10 P.M. EST  THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, General Caslen.  Your wife informed me that it was not booing that I heard when you came up, but it was “Supe.”  (Laughter.)  Give this wonderful superintendent a round of applause, would you please?  He deserves it, and the nation is proud of your service.  (Applause.)  General Holland, General Jebb, Captain Villanueva, distinguished guests, and core of cadets of the United States Military Academy -- it is an extraordinary privilege for me to be with you tonight.  Two special guests are with me that I want to acknowledge.  A man who I knew before he was even elected to the Congress, and now he is one of the most prominent members of the United States Senate; Senator Tim Scott is with us tonight just to be with all of you.  Senator Scott, thank you for joining us this evening.  (Applause.)  And my commanding officer is with us, as well.  My wife of 31 years -- (laughter) -- Karen Pence is in the house.  Would you make her feel welcome?  (Applause.)  I’m very humbled to have raised my right hand just a few short weeks ago to accept the responsibilities and be Vice President of the United States of America.   And by the power vested in me, I hear by grant amnesty for all minor conduct offenses of those present.  (Applause.)  I’m not sure I’ll be asked back now.  But it’s really good to be with you all and, frankly, very humbling. I came here on behalf of the President of the United States, your Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump, and I bring you his greetings and his gratitude.  (Applause.)   I left the Oval Office when I headed to West Point this afternoon, and the President insisted that I send his greetings to all of you, his heartfelt thanks for your willingness to serve our great country. But more than that, the President sends his commitment to you that President Donald Trump and this administration will stand with you as you stand to defend the United States of America.  (Applause.)  I tell you it’s the greatest privilege of my life to serve with the 45th President.  But it’s a special honor to serve with a President so dedicated to America’s Armed Forces. You know, being here tonight is a humbling experience for me, and it’s very moving.  You see, I’m not a soldier.  My life did not take that path.  But I am the son of a soldier and the proud father of a United States Marine.   My father, you’ll be glad to know, Ed Pence, was member of the United States Army.  (Applause.)  My dad served in combat in Korea.  And he’s one of those people that earned some medals on this chest and came home and put them in the drawer.  The best man I ever knew.  He’s been gone some three decades now in our family, but he’s still the greatest influence on my life every day. I’m not only the proud son of someone in the service, but my wife, Karen, and I are also the proud parents of a son who answered the call of duty.  Our son is right now serving in the Marine Corps as a second lieutenant.  And like all of you, his highest hope is to serve our country with great distinction.  And on behalf of all of your parents, these parents say, you all make us proud.  Give yourselves a round of applause, would you please?  (Applause.)  I know your parents have the same faith that we have, that each one of you are going to continue this path you have chosen with great distinction.  We have faith in you and faith in the principles you've come to serve.  We have faith because of those who have walked this same path as you, in ages past.  The training that you're receiving here has been generations in the making.   I just had a wonderful gathering with a number of your most distinguished and accomplished fellow cadets.  And I heard their calling here was not just to serve the country, but to grow as leaders. We’re really standing -- we're standing where generations have stood -- on hallowed ground.  If you think about it, for over 200 years, men and women from across our country have come to these grounds, driven here by that call to serve, that call to leadership -- of duty, honor, country.  They came here separately, in different eras, with different pasts.  Yet they all left as one, didn't they?  Forever bound to each other each one of you are, as brothers and sisters, gripping hands in the Long Grey Line.  And the American people are proud of each and every one of you in this room. That line remains unbroken to this day, and so long as it continues, everyone who calls our country home can know with absolute certainty that the United States of America -- our home, our homeland -- will be safe.  So it is humbling for me to be here, one of the people that has been benefited by those countless generations that have gone before.  It’s humbling especially to be where so many courageous Americans prepare to protect families like mine.  And it’s humbling to stand before all of you, who gladly follow in their footsteps.  You are all already true leaders, and you are all already patriots.  President Trump and I thank you.  We thank you for answering the call to serve your country -- to put America first.  Now, President Trump has made a solemn promise to all of you and to everyone who wears the uniform.  On Monday, he gave a speech earlier this week, in which he essentially promised to stand with and “protect those who protect us.”  He promised in his words to give you “the tools, the equipment, the resources, the training, and the supplies you need to get the job done.”  And he promised to “honor our sacred bond to those who serve.”  These are the President’s promises to all of you.  And make no mistake about it those promises will be kept in this administration.  (Applause.)   That’s really why I’m here tonight on the President’s behalf.  Honoring those who serve our country requires recognizing the men and women who achieve extraordinary things in the line of duty. There’s a passage in the Old Book.  I try and open it up and read it every morning.  It says, “If you owe debts, pay debts.  If honor, then honor.  If respect, then respect.”   And tonight marks the 40th Annual Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper Dinner, which is all about doing just that. It commemorates a man who we just heard overcame extraordinary adversity -- demonstrated leadership, self-discipline, and courage in service to this country.  The year 1877, only twelve years before, the horrible evil of slavery, that great stain on our experiment in self-government, had finally been eradicated in the fires of the Civil War.  And out of those ashes emerged hope -- hope that America’s founding promise of equality and freedom would finally be made real for all Americans. It was in this hope that spurred Henry Flipper to write his congressman, James Freeman, to request an appointment to the finest military academy in the world.  Henry’s skill with the written word impressed Freeman, we are told, who determined that he was indeed worthy. So came Henry Flipper to where we stand today.  All who attend West Point face many trials, but Henry Flipper faced many more that we all understand by virtue of his willingness to challenge the status quo, challenge the injustices of his day.  He persevered through four years, making history as the First African American ever to graduate from the United States Military Academy.  But as we just heard his struggles would continue.  He was ejected from the Army only four years later after being accused of a crime he did not commit.  After Henry passed away, a band of patriotic Americans took up his cause.  And thanks to their efforts, the Army righted this wrong by retroactively awarding Henry Flipper an honorable discharge in 1976.  And you heard that President Clinton pardoned him in the years that followed. The following year after he was honorably discharged, his alma mater began to celebrate his accomplishments with the first installment of the dinner we have here tonight.  Fittingly, I’m told the first Henry O. Flipper Dinner was held 100 years after his groundbreaking graduation from West Point.  Altogether fitting. But the purpose of tonight, I’m told, is not just to remember Henry Flipper and his extraordinary courage and accomplishment, but it’s held every year in the midst of African American History Month.  A week ago today, President Trump signed a proclamation honoring this occasion and declaring that “the history of African Americans exemplifies the resilience and the spirit that continue to make our Nation great.” We need only look at Henry Flipper’s life to see this truth in this statement.  But we should also look back to the generations of African Americans who have defended and died for this country as far back as the very hour of our nation’s birth. When I think of these brave men and women, I can't help but think of that famous painting, it’s known as Washington’s Crossing.  It depicts George Washington and his band crossing the Delaware.  If you look closely, if you haven’t looked at that painting, and it’s one of my favorites, you’ll see someone who is sometimes overlooked.  Next to General Washington himself, immediately to his left, is a young African American solider.  The symbolism is profound.  The painting was rendered by a German abolitionist who was determined to recognize the countless African Americans who fought side by side with our Founders in the pursuit of a free America -- of liberty and equality for all.  Men like Crispus Attucks, who perished in the Boston Massacre, or Lemuel Hayes, who fought at Lexington and Concord, or the dozens who enlisted in the First Rhode Island Regiment, just to name a few. In New England, some African American patriots rose as high as the rank of colonel.  Yet no matter their rank, they were, all of them, every bit as freedom-loving and dedicated to independence as George Washington himself. Tonight I think of them -- but, of course, not only them.  I think of the nearly 200,000 African Americans who fought for the Union in the Civil War and for the new birth of freedom that followed it. I think of the Buffalo Soldiers we learned tonight that Henry Flipper was among them who actually helped tame the West.  I think of the Tuskegee Airmen who flew for freedom in World War Two -- men like General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., whose strength of character carried him through four difficult years at West Point, and who is now honored for his resolve with a barracks that bears his name.  I think of all these heroes in this month, and many more I haven’t mentioned, because they are the best of us.  And during this month, African American History Month, but not only this month, we remember them and we thank them for what they did.  Their names and their sacrifices will never be forgotten.  For they understood the promise of America -- the timeless ideals that bind us together as a people, and give us purpose as a nation. That's why we are here tonight.  We know in our hearts that America is extraordinary and that our sacred birthright must be defended, no matter the cost.  This gift has always inspired our fellow Americans to step up and serve, and I believe it always will.  It certainly inspired Henry Flipper and all those that we reflect on tonight.  He persevered not just through four years at West Point, but over injustice itself.  We remember and honor him tonight for his unyielding tenacity in the face of hardship. Henry’s life always be a model for those who find towering barriers standing before them waiting to be overcome.  For 40 years now, the United States Corps of Cadets has chosen one of its own who has embodied Henry’s courage, his leadership, his determination to let no obstacle stand in his way.  And tonight that honor falls to Cadet Lars Lofgren.  (Applause.)   Cadet Lofgren personifies the legacy of Henry Flipper and all the other previous recipients of the Flipper award.  As all of you know, two years ago, Cadet Lofgren was tragically injured during a training exercise at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  Since that day, he has been paralyzed from the waist down.  But he didn’t let it stop him.  Less than 12 months later, he participated -- I had to read this twice -- he participated in the 2016 Warrior Games, where he won an astounding seven medals.  (Applause.)  Not only that, he then returned to West Point to complete his final year -- such is his love for America, for this great institution, and his sense of duty.  Cadet Lofgren, you are an inspiration to us all.  You are truly a worthy recipient of the Henry Flipper Award.  And I’m honored to be here tonight to be a part of watching you receive it.  And tonight you will receive it from none other than one of Henry’s descendants, Ken Davis.  And we thank him so much for being with us today. I know everyone joins me in congratulating Cadet Lofgren and the honor he gives us by being here tonight. The legacy of Henry Flipper lives on in many others, including two distinguished guests we have with us tonight. Pat Locke, who retired from the Army as a major, is here with us this evening.  She’s a trailblazer cut from the same cloth as Henry Flipper himself.  In 1980, she departed from these grounds -- stand up and take a bow.  Would you please?  (Applause.)  Thank you, Major.  In 1980, she departed from these grounds as the first-ever, female African American graduate of West Point.  We also have with us Cadet Christian Nattiel.  He is the first African American from West Point to receive the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship and will soon head to Oxford to teach them a thing or two.  (Applause.)  All those whom I have recognized are heirs of a long and proud tradition that stretches back into the mists of American history.  But they are not the only ones.  It is this same tradition that really brings all of us here tonight and together. Now, we've not come to West Point, nor did our forefathers, because of the color of our skin or the creed we profess.  We gather because of our country -- a country that has given us so much, and to which we are now called to give in return. One of my late father’s favorite versus was:  To whom much is given, much will be required.   And I know that every one of you that has stepped forward to be a part of this incredible tradition to serve your country feels that in your heart.  You cadets before me have answered that call.  You've stepped up, and soon you will go forth. Last night was Post Night, I’m told, when the graduating seniors learned where they will be stationed.  You will, all of you, do our country proud, so that future generations may yet call themselves sons and daughters of America.  Let’s give all of those who participated in Post Night a round of applause.  (Applause.)   Your accomplishments here at West Point, your leadership speaks louder than anyone could at a dinner like tonight. And your service is needed now more than ever.  Beyond our nation’s borders lies a world riven by conflict and oftentimes wracked by chaos.  Evil abounds across the globe.  Old enemies have reared their ugly heads once more, and new ones have arisen, too.  The forces of radical Islam terrorism seek to destroy not only our people, but our very way of life.  The barbarians known as ISIS are brutally killing anyone who stands in the way of their attempts to establish a global caliphate.  They will not stop until we stop them.  And we will stop them.  (Applause.)  The threats facing America have never been more numerous, it seems sometimes, more sophisticated, more zealous in their adherence to failed ideas that belong in the ash-heap of history.  But make no mistake about it:  President Trump and this administration and this country will not rest until these enemies are destroyed and our nation is safe again.  (Applause.)  And I promise you -- I promise you, those of you that are preparing to enter the service of the United States of America on your graduation of West Point, we will not relent in our effort until we have rebuilt the arsenal of democracy and ensured that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard have the resources and the training they need to accomplish their mission, protect our families, and come home safe to theirs.  That is our promise.  (Applause.)  Rest assured, I can testify from what I see in him every day, America has a President and a Commander-in-Chief who loves the armed forces and will stand with you every day.  I’ve seen his dedication to you more times than I can count.  In fact, I see it literally on a daily basis. Under his leadership, I can promise you three things.  First, know that President Trump and I will always have your backs.  You will have everything you need, and more, to defeat those who confront our nation and threaten our freedom, and to protect this country. Secondly, know that you and your families in the days ahead will always have our prayers, and the prayers of the American people will go with you as you serve.  Of this I’m confident. And last, know that we will always support you, not second-guess you, and we will never call your courageous service or your sacrifice a failure. Before I leave, I can’t help but recall the words that the General just shared with me.  We took a stroll, didn't we, General, down a block to see that MacArthur statue?  And I polished his boot.  (Laughter.)  Before I left the Oval Office this afternoon, the President told me, you have to go down to the MacArthur statue.  We did.  And I read those words that were I think first spoken in this very room, and they're words that really represent the foundation of the past, present, and the future of this extraordinary institution and the tradition that you've embraced -- duty, honor, country. MacArthur said: “Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, and what you will be.  They are your rallying points to build courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when hope becomes forlorn.” Stirring words on a cold night, they warmed my heart because I knew I’d be looking out on a roomful of men and women who were living out that every single day. You know to serve with President Trump is to serve with someone who has boundless confidence in the American people and boundless optimism about America’s future.  And it’s an honor to be with you tonight. But let me say what the President would say if he was here, that looking out at your shining faces, seeing your dedication to America, we're more confident than ever that the best days for America are yet to come. Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless West Point.  And God bless the United States of America. END   7:33 P.M.

Truman During his few weeks as Vice President, Harry Truman scarcely saw President Franklin Roosevelt, and received no briefing on the development of the atomic bomb or the unfolding difficulties with Soviet Russia. Suddenly these and a host of other wartime problems became Truman's to solve when, on April 12, 1945, he became America's 33rd President. During his few weeks as Vice President, Harry S. Truman scarcely saw President Roosevelt, and received no briefing on the development of the atomic bomb or the unfolding difficulties with Soviet Russia. Suddenly these and a host of other wartime problems became Truman's to solve when, on April 12, 1945, he became President. He told reporters, ""I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me."" Truman was born in Lamar, Missouri, in 1884. He grew up in Independence, and for 12 years prospered as a Missouri farmer. He went to France during World War I as a captain in the Field Artillery. Returning, he married Elizabeth Virginia Wallace, and opened a haberdashery in Kansas City. Active in the Democratic Party, Truman was elected a judge of the Jackson County Court (an administrative position) in 1922. He became a Senator in 1934. During World War II he headed the Senate war investigating committee, checking into waste and corruption and saving perhaps as much as 15 billion dollars. As President, Truman made some of the most crucial decisions in history. Soon after V-E Day, the war against Japan had reached its final stage. An urgent plea to Japan to surrender was rejected. Truman, after consultations with his advisers, ordered atomic bombs dropped on cities devoted to war work. Two were Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japanese surrender quickly followed. In June 1945 Truman witnessed the signing of the charter of the United Nations, hopefully established to preserve peace. Thus far, he had followed his predecessor's policies, but he soon developed his own. He presented to Congress a 21-point program, proposing the expansion of Social Security, a full-employment program, a permanent Fair Employment Practices Act, and public housing and slum clearance. The program, Truman wrote, ""symbolizes for me my assumption of the office of President in my own right."" It became known as the Fair Deal. Dangers and crises marked the foreign scene as Truman campaigned successfully in 1948. In foreign affairs he was already providing his most effective leadership. In 1947 as the Soviet Union pressured Turkey and, through guerrillas, threatened to take over Greece, he asked Congress to aid the two countries, enunciating the program that bears his name--the Truman Doctrine. The Marshall Plan, named for his Secretary of State, stimulated spectacular economic recovery in war-torn western Europe. When the Russians blockaded the western sectors of Berlin in 1948, Truman created a massive airlift to supply Berliners until the Russians backed down. Meanwhile, he was negotiating a military alliance to protect Western nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, established in 1949. In June 1950, when the Communist government of North Korea attacked South Korea, Truman conferred promptly with his military advisers. There was, he wrote, ""complete, almost unspoken acceptance on the part of everyone that whatever had to be done to meet this aggression had to be done. There was no suggestion from anyone that either the United Nations or the United States could back away from it."" A long, discouraging struggle ensued as U.N. forces held a line above the old boundary of South Korea. Truman kept the war a limited one, rather than risk a major conflict with China and perhaps Russia. Deciding not to run again, he retired to Independence; at age 88, he died December 26, 1972, after a stubborn fight for life.

In a 1946 letter to the National Urban League, President Truman wrote that the government has ""an obligation to see that the civil rights of every citizen are fully and equally protected.” He ended racial segregation in civil service and the armed forces in 1948.

EST PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Prime Minister Trudeau, on behalf of all Americans, I thank you for being with us today.  It is my honor to host such a great friend, neighbor, and ally at the White House, a very special place.  This year, Canada celebrates the 150th year of Confederation.  For Americans, this is one of the many milestones in our friendship, and we look forward -- very much forward, I must say -- to many more to come.  Our two nations share much more than a border.  We share the same values.  We share the love, and a truly great love, of freedom.  And we share a collective defense.  American and Canadian troops have gone to battle together, fought wars together, and forged the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together -- which we have. In these dangerous times, it is more important than ever that we continue to strengthen our vital alliance.  The United States is deeply grateful for Canada’s contribution to the counter-ISIS effort.  Thank you.  And we continue to work in common, and in common cause, against terrorism, and work in common cooperation toward reciprocal trade and shared growth. We understand that both of our countries are stronger when we join forces in matters of international commerce.  Having more jobs and trade right here in North America is better for both the United States and is also much better for Canada.  We should coordinate closely -- and we will coordinate closely -- to protect jobs in our hemisphere and keep wealth on our continent, and to keep everyone safe. Prime Minister, I pledge to work with you in pursuit of our many shared interests.  This includes a stronger trading relationship between the United States and Canada.  It includes safe, efficient, and responsible cross-border travel and migration.  And it includes close partnership on domestic and international security.  America is deeply fortunate to have a neighbor like Canada.  We have before us the opportunity to build even more bridges, and bridges of cooperation and bridges of commerce.  Both of us are committed to bringing greater prosperity and opportunity to our people. We just had a very productive meeting with women business leaders from the United States and Canada, where we discussed how to secure everything that we know the full power of women can do better than anybody else.  We know that.  I just want to say, Mr. Prime Minister, that I'm focused and you're focused on the important role women play in our economies.  We must work to address the barriers faced by women and women entrepreneurs, including access to capital, access to markets, and, very importantly, access to networks. In our discussion today we will focus on improving the ways our government and our governments together can benefit citizens of both the United States and Canada, and, in so doing, advance the greater peace and stability of the world. Mr. Prime Minister, I look forward to working closely with you to build upon our very historic friendship.  There are incredible possibilities for us to pursue, Canada and the United States together.   Again, thank you for joining us, and I know our discussions will be very, very productive for the future of both countries.  Mr. Prime Minister. PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you very much for joining us.   I'd first like to start by extending my sincere thanks to President Trump for inviting me down to Washington.  Any day I get to visit our southern neighbors is a good day in my book, particularly when it's so nice and warm compared to what it is back home.  We are suffering under a significant winter storm that's hitting our Atlantic provinces particularly harsh, so I just want to send everyone back at home my thoughts as they shovel out, and impress on everyone to stay safe. (As interpreted from French.)  The President and myself have had a very productive first meeting today.  We had the opportunity to get to know one another better, and, more importantly, we had the opportunity to talk about the unique relationship between Canada and the United States. (In English.)  Ends on both sides of the 49th parallel have understood that the bond between our nations is a special one.  No other neighbors in the entire world are as fundamentally linked as we are.  We've fought in conflict zones together, negotiated environmental treaties together, including 1991's historic Air Quality Agreement.  And we've entered into groundbreaking economic partnerships that have created good jobs for both of our peoples. Canadians and Americans alike share a common history as well as people-to-people ties that make us completely and totally integrated.  Our workers are connected by trade, transportation and cross-border commerce.  Our communities rely on each other for security, stability and economic prosperity.  Our families have long lived together and worked together.  We know that, more often than not, our victories are shared.  And just as we celebrate together, so too do we suffer loss and heartbreak together. Through it all, the foundational pillar upon which our relationship is built is one of mutual respect.  And that's a good thing, because as we know, relationships between neighbors are pretty complex and we won't always agree on everything.  But because of our deep, abiding respect for one another, we're able to successfully navigate those complexities and still remain the closest of allies and friends.  Make no mistake -- at the end of the day, Canada and the U.S. will always remain each other's most essential partner. And today's conversations have served to reinforce how important that is for both Canadians and Americans.  As we know, 35 U.S. states list Canada as their largest export market, and our economies benefit from the over $2 billion in two-way trade that takes place every single day.  Millions of good, middle-class jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership.  Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and we're going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead. (As interpreted from French.)  As we know, 35 U.S. states list Canada as their largest export market and our economies benefit from the over $2 billion in two-way trade that takes place every single day.  Millions of good, middle-class jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership.  Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and we’re going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead. (In English.)  I'd like to highlight just a few of the specifics that President Trump and I discussed today.  At the end of the day, the President and I share a common goal.  We both want to make sure that hardworking folks can go to work at a good job, put food on the table for their families, and save up to take a vacation every once in a while.  That’s what we’re trying to do here. Today, we reiterated that our nations are committed to collaborating on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment.  And, as we know, investing in infrastructure is a great way to create the kind of economic growth that our countries so desperately need.   In that same vein, we know that ensuring equal opportunities for women in the workforce is essential for growing the economy and maintaining American and Canadian competitiveness on the world stage.  As such, the President and I have agreed to the creation of the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders.  This initiative is more than just about dollars and cents.  This is about ensuring that women have access to the same opportunities as men, and prioritizing the support and empowerment of women who are senior business leaders and entrepreneurs.  In doing so, we’ll grow the Canadian and American economies, and help our businesses prosper. (As interpreted from French.)  Finally, President Trump and myself have agreed to work together to fight against the traffic of opioids across our border.  The rise of illegal use of opioids in our society is nothing less than a tragedy.  We will do everything we can to ensure the safety of Canadians and Americans.   Ladies and gentlemen, President Trump:  I know that if our countries continue to work together, our people will greatly benefit from this cooperation.   (In English.)  History has demonstrated time and again that in order to tackle our most pressing issues, both foreign and domestic, we must work with our closest allies, learn from each other, and stand in solidarity as a united voice. With a level of economic and social integration that is unmatched on the world stage, Canada and the United States will forever be a model example of how to be good neighbors.  Winston Churchill once said, “That long Canadian frontier from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans, guarded only by neighborly respect and honorable obligations, is an example to every country, and a pattern for the future of the world.”  That, my friends, is the very essence of the Canada-U.S. relationship. I look forward to working with President Trump over the coming years to nurture and build upon this historic partnership.  Once again, it’s a tremendous pleasure to be here in Washington.  Merci beaucoup.   PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay, we’ll take a couple of questions.  Scott Thuman.  Scott.   Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  You just spoke about the desire to build bridges, although there are some notable and philosophical differences between yourself and Prime Minister Trudeau.  I’m curious, as you move forward on issues from trade to terrorism, how do you see this relationship playing out?  And are there any specific areas with which during your conversations today you each decided to perhaps alter or amend your stances already on those sensitive issues like terrorism and immigration? And, Prime Minister Trudeau, while only in its infancy so far, how do you see this relationship compared to that under the Obama administration? PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, we just began discussions.  We are going to have a great relationship with Canada, maybe as good or better, hopefully, than ever before.  We have some wonderful ideas on immigration.  We have some, I think, very strong, very tough ideas on the tremendous problem that we have with terrorism.  And I think when we put them all together, which will be very, very quickly -- we have a group of very talented people -- we will see some very, very obvious results.  We're also doing some cross-border things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot better and a lot faster for trade. We have -- through technology, we have some really great ideas, and they’ll be implemented fairly quickly.  PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  One of the things we spoke about was the fact that security and immigration need to work very well together.  And certainly Canada has emphasized security as we look towards improving our immigration system and remaining true to the values that we have.  And we had a very strong and fruitful discussion on exactly that. There’s plenty that we can draw on each other from in terms of how we move forward with a very similar goal, which is to create free, open societies that keep our citizens safe.  And that's certainly something that we're very much in agreement on. Tonda MacCharles. Q    Good afternoon, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister.  And, Mr. Prime Minister, could you answer in English and French for us, please?  A little bit of a follow-on on my American colleague’s question.  President Trump, you seem to suggest that Syrian refugees are a Trojan horse for potential terrorism, while the Prime Minister hugs refugees and welcomes them with open arms.  So I’d like to know, are you confident the northern border is secure? PRESIDENT TRUMP:  You can never be totally confident.  But through the incredible efforts -- already I see it happening -- of formerly General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, we have really done a great job.  We're actually taking people that are criminals -- very, very hardened criminals in some cases, with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems -- and we're getting them out.  And that's what I said I would do.  I’m just doing what I said I would do when we won by a very, very large Electoral College vote.  And I knew that was going to happen.  I knew this is what people were wanting.  And that wasn’t the only reason, that wasn’t my only thing that we did so well on.  But that was something was very important.  And I said we will get the criminals out, the drug lords, the gang members.  We're getting them out. General Kelly, who is sitting right here, is doing a fantastic job.  And I said at the beginning we are going to get the bad ones -- the really bad ones, we're getting them out.  And that's exactly what we're doing. I think that in the end everyone is going to be extremely happy.  And I will tell you right now, a lot of people are very, very happy right now. PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Canada has always understood that keeping Canadians safe is one of the fundamental responsibilities of any government.  And that's certainly something that we're very much focused on.   At the same time, we continue to pursue our policies of openness towards immigration, refugees, without compromising security.  And part of the reason we have been successful in doing that over the past year -- welcoming close to 40,000 Syrian refugees -- is because we have been coordinating with our allies, the United States and around the world, to demonstrate that security comes very seriously to us.  And that's something that we continue to deal with. (As interpreted from French.)  It is clear that if you want to have a healthy and secure society or safe society, you have to make sure that you maintain -- that you focus on security.  And we have welcomed refugees from Syria.  We have been very successful, but we have always taken our responsibility toward security very seriously.  And our allies, including the United States, understand this focus very well.  And they have done so since the very beginning. PRESIDENT TRUMP:   Caitlin Collins (ph), please. Q    Thank you.  President Trump, now that you've been in office and received intelligence briefings for nearly one month, what do you see as the most important national security matters facing us?   And, Prime Minister Trudeau, you've made very clear that Canada has an open-door policy for Syrian refugees.  Do you believe that President Trump’s moratorium on immigration has merit on national security grounds? PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay.  Thank you.  Many, many problems.  When I was campaigning, I said it’s not a good situation.  Now that I see it -- including with our intelligence briefings -- we have problems that a lot of people have no idea how bad they are, how serious they are, not only internationally, but when you come right here. Obviously, North Korea is a big, big problem, and we will deal with that very strongly.  We have problems all over the Middle East.  We have problems just about every corner of the globe, no matter where you look.  I had a great meeting this weekend with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and got to know each other very, very well -- extended weekend, really.  We were with each other for long periods of time, and our staffs and representatives.   But on the home front, we have to create borders.  We have to let people that can love our country in, and I want to do that.  We want to have a big, beautiful, open door, and we want people to come in and come in our country.  But we cannot let the wrong people in, and I will not allow that to happen during this administration.  And people -- citizens of our country want that, and that's their attitude, too.   I will tell you, we are getting such praise for our stance, and it's a stance of common sense -- maybe a certain toughness, but it's really more than toughness, it's a stance of common sense -- and we are going to pursue it vigorously.  And we don't want to have our country have the kinds of problems that you're witnessing taking place not only here but all over the world.  We won't stand for it.  We won't put up with it.  We're just not going to let it happen.  We're going to give ourselves every bit of chance so that things go well for the United States.  And they will go well.  Thank you. PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  Canada and the United States have been neighbors a long time, and Canadians and Americans have stood together, worked together at home and around the world.  We've fought and died together in battlefields in World War I and World War II, in Korea, in Afghanistan.  But there have been times where we have differed in our approaches, and that's always been done firmly and respectfully. The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves.  My role and our responsibility is to continue to govern in such a way that reflects Canadians' approach and be a positive example in the world. Richard Latendresse.   Q    Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  I'll ask my question in French first and then, for you, I'll -- again in English.   (As interpreted from French.)  Mr. Prime Minister, if I heard you correctly, you said that Canadian businesses, Canadian workers are concerned for their businesses and for their work and jobs concerning the renegotiation of NAFTA.  So what guarantees did you get from this government that we will keep our jobs and our businesses in the renegotiation of NAFTA? (In English.)  Mr. President, again, during the last three months, you have denounced NAFTA.  You have talked over and over about the Mexican portion of the agreement, very little about the Canadian one.  My question is in two short part is, is Canada a fair trader?  And when you talk about changes to NAFTA concerning Canada, are you talking about big changes or small changes?  Thank you. PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU:  (As interpreted.)  First of all, Richard, thank you for your question.  It is a real concern for many Canadians because we know that our economy is very dependent on our bonds, our relationship with the United States.  Goods and services do cross the border each way every single day, and this means a lot of millions of jobs for Canadians, and good jobs for Canadians.  So we are always focusing on these jobs, but there are also good jobs, millions of jobs, in the United States that depend on those relationships between our two countries. So when we sit down as we did today, and as our teams will be doing in the weeks and months to come, we will be talking about how we can continue to create good jobs for our citizens on both sides of the border.  And during this exercise, we continue to understand that we have to allow this free flow of goods and services, and we have to be aware of the integration of our economies, which is extremely positive for both our countries.  And this is the focus that we will have in the coming weeks and months to come. (In English.)  Canadians are rightly aware of the fact that much of our economy depends on good working relationships with the United States, a good integration with the American economy.  And the fact is, millions of good jobs on both sides of the border depend on the smooth and easy flow of goods and services and people back and forth across our border.   And both President Trump and I got elected on commitments to support the middle class, to work hard for people who need a real shot at success.  And we know that by working together, by ensuring the continued effective integration of our two economies, we are going to be creating greater opportunities for middle-class Canadians and Americans now and well into the future. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I agree with that 100 percent.  We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada.  We’ll be tweaking it.  We’ll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries.  It’s a much less severe situation than what’s taking place on the southern border.  On the southern border, for many, many years, the transaction was not fair to the United States.  It was an extremely unfair transaction.  We’re going to work with Mexico, we’re going to make it a fair deal for both parties.  I think that we’re going to get along very well with Mexico; they understand and we understand. You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country.  You saw Intel the other day announce that because of what I’ve been doing and what I’m doing in terms of regulation -- lowering taxes, et cetera -- they’re coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment, and thousands of thousands of jobs.  General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants.  Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they’re doing the same.  Jack Ma -- we have so many people that want to come into the United States.  It’s actually very exciting.   I think it’s going to be a very exciting period of time for the United States and for the workers of the United States, because they have been truly the forgotten man and forgotten women.  It’s not going to be forgotten anymore, believe me. So our relationship with Canada is outstanding, and we’re going to work together to make it even better.  And as far as the southern border is concerned, we’re going to get that worked out.  We’re going to make it fair, but we are going to make it so that everybody is happy.  It’s very important to me.   Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)    END  2:42 P.M.

Where the Executive and Legislative branches are elected by the people, members of the Judicial Branch are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Article III of the Constitution, which establishes the Judicial Branch, leaves Congress significant discretion to determine the shape and structure of the federal judiciary. Even the number of Supreme Court Justices is left to Congress — at times there have been as few as six, while the current number (nine, with one Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices) has only been in place since 1869. The Constitution also grants Congress the power to establish courts inferior to the Supreme Court, and to that end Congress has established the United States district courts, which try most federal cases, and 13 United States courts of appeals, which review appealed district court cases. Federal judges can only be removed through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction in the Senate. Judges and justices serve no fixed term — they serve until their death, retirement, or conviction by the Senate. By design, this insulates them from the temporary passions of the public, and allows them to apply the law with only justice in mind, and not electoral or political concerns. Generally, Congress determines the jurisdiction of the federal courts. In some cases, however — such as in the example of a dispute between two or more U.S. states — the Constitution grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction, an authority that cannot be stripped by Congress. The courts only try actual cases and controversies — a party must show that it has been harmed in order to bring suit in court. This means that the courts do not issue advisory opinions on the constitutionality of laws or the legality of actions if the ruling would have no practical effect. Cases brought before the judiciary typically proceed from district court to appellate court and may even end at the Supreme Court, although the Supreme Court hears comparatively few cases each year. Federal courts enjoy the sole power to interpret the law, determine the constitutionality of the law, and apply it to individual cases. The courts, like Congress, can compel the production of evidence and testimony through the use of a subpoena. The inferior courts are constrained by the decisions of the Supreme Court — once the Supreme Court interprets a law, inferior courts must apply the Supreme Court's interpretation to the facts of a particular case. The Supreme Court of the United States | The Judicial Process The Supreme Court of the United States The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in the land and the only part of the federal judiciary specifically required by the Constitution. The Constitution does not stipulate the number of Supreme Court Justices; the number is set instead by Congress. There have been as few as six, but since 1869 there have been nine Justices, including one Chief Justice. All Justices are nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, and hold their offices under life tenure. Since Justices do not have to run or campaign for re-election, they are thought to be insulated from political pressure when deciding cases. Justices may remain in office until they resign, pass away, or are impeached and convicted by Congress. The Court's caseload is almost entirely appellate in nature, and the Court's decisions cannot be appealed to any authority, as it is the final judicial arbiter in the United States on matters of federal law. However, the Court may consider appeals from the highest state courts or from federal appellate courts. The Court also has original jurisdiction in cases involving ambassadors and other diplomats, and in cases between states. Although the Supreme Court may hear an appeal on any question of law provided it has jurisdiction, it usually does not hold trials. Instead, the Court's task is to interpret the meaning of a law, to decide whether a law is relevant to a particular set of facts, or to rule on how a law should be applied. Lower courts are obligated to follow the precedent set by the Supreme Court when rendering decisions. In almost all instances, the Supreme Court does not hear appeals as a matter of right; instead, parties must petition the Court for a writ of certiorari. It is the Court's custom and practice to ""grant cert"" if four of the nine Justices decide that they should hear the case. Of the approximately 7,500 requests for certiorari filed each year, the Court usually grants cert to fewer than 150. These are typically cases that the Court considers sufficiently important to require their review; a common example is the occasion when two or more of the federal courts of appeals have ruled differently on the same question of federal law. If the Court grants certiorari, Justices accept legal briefs from the parties to the case, as well as from amicus curiae, or ""friends of the court."" These can include industry trade groups, academics, or even the U.S. government itself. Before issuing a ruling, the Supreme Court usually hears oral arguments, where the various parties to the suit present their arguments and the Justices ask them questions. If the case involves the federal government, the Solicitor General of the United States presents arguments on behalf of the United States. The Justices then hold private conferences, make their decision, and (often after a period of several months) issue the Court's opinion, along with any dissenting arguments that may have been written. The Judicial Process Article III of the Constitution of the United States guarantees that every person accused of wrongdoing has the right to a fair trial before a competent judge and a jury of one's peers. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution provide additional protections for those accused of a crime. These include: A guarantee that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without the due process of law Protection against being tried for the same crime twice (""double jeopardy"") The right to a speedy trial by an impartial jury The right to cross-examine witnesses, and to call witnesses to support their case The right to legal representation The right to avoid self-incrimination Protection from excessive bail, excessive fines, and cruel and unusual punishments Criminal proceedings can be conducted under either state or federal law, depending on the nature and extent of the crime. A criminal legal procedure typically begins with an arrest by a law enforcement officer. If a grand jury chooses to deliver an indictment, the accused will appear before a judge and be formally charged with a crime, at which time he or she may enter a plea. The defendant is given time to review all the evidence in the case and to build a legal argument. Then, the case is brought to trial and decided by a jury. If the defendant is determined to be not guilty of the crime, the charges are dismissed. Otherwise, the judge determines the sentence, which can include prison time, a fine, or even execution. Civil cases are similar to criminal ones, but instead of arbitrating between the state and a person or organization, they deal with disputes between individuals or organizations. If a party believes that it has been wronged, it can file suit in civil court to attempt to have that wrong remedied through an order to cease and desist, alter behavior, or award monetary damages. After the suit is filed and evidence is gathered and presented by both sides, a trial proceeds as in a criminal case. If the parties involved waive their right to a jury trial, the case can be decided by a judge; otherwise, the case is decided and damages awarded by a jury. After a criminal or civil case is tried, it may be appealed to a higher court — a federal court of appeals or state appellate court. A litigant who files an appeal, known as an ""appellant,"" must show that the trial court or administrative agency made a legal error that affected the outcome of the case. An appellate court makes its decision based on the record of the case established by the trial court or agency — it does not receive additional evidence or hear witnesses. It may also review the factual findings of the trial court or agency, but typically may only overturn a trial outcome on factual grounds if the findings were ""clearly erroneous."" If a defendant is found not guilty in a criminal proceeding, he or she cannot be retried on the same set of facts. Federal appeals are decided by panels of three judges. The appellant presents legal arguments to the panel, in a written document called a ""brief."" In the brief, the appellant tries to persuade the judges that the trial court made an error, and that the lower decision should be reversed. On the other hand, the party defending against the appeal, known as the ""appellee"" or ""respondent,"" tries in its brief to show why the trial court decision was correct, or why any errors made by the trial court are not significant enough to affect the outcome of the case. The court of appeals usually has the final word in the case, unless it sends the case back to the trial court for additional proceedings. In some cases the decision may be reviewed en banc — that is, by a larger group of judges of the court of appeals for the circuit. A litigant who loses in a federal court of appeals, or in the highest court of a state, may file a petition for a ""writ of certiorari,"" which is a document asking the Supreme Court to review the case. The Supreme Court, however, is not obligated to grant review. The Court typically will agree to hear a case only when it involves a new and important legal principle, or when two or more federal appellate courts have interpreted a law differently. (There are also special circumstances in which the Supreme Court is required by law to hear an appeal.) When the Supreme Court hears a case, the parties are required to file written briefs and the Court may hear oral argument.   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

Brady Press Briefing Room  1:53 P.M. EST MR. SPICER:  Here we go.  Good afternoon, everyone.  As you just saw, the President was honored to host the swearing-in of Attorney General Sessions in the Oval Office just a short time ago.  Under Attorney General Sessions, the Justice Department will return to its original, core mission:  to uphold the rule of law to ensure that justice is administered and enforced fairly and impartially for all Americans.  Attorney General Sessions is a world-class legal mind and experienced prosecutor, and the President is pleased to have him finally in place as our nation’s top law enforcement officer. After the Attorney General’s swearing-in, the President signed three executive orders dedicated to standing behind the police officers who risk their lives every day to protect us and our communities, reducing crime, and stopping cartel violence.  The first executive order directs the newly installed Attorney General to develop a strategy for more effectively prosecuting people who commit violence against members of law enforcement.  We must better protect those who protect us.  Our men and women in blue need to know that we're with them 100 percent as they patrol our streets.  Unfortunately, this has not always been the case.  Law enforcement officials have been vocal about the lack of support they received under the past administration.  This lack of support demoralized many officers and, in some cases, led to their discouraging their engagement with local communities, only causing further harm and deterioration. It's imperative that federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies better coordinate and share information across jurisdictions to better serve and protect our communities.  This order will start the important work of doing just that, instituting a holistic approach that involves the whole of government.  It also directs the Department of Justice to work with other federal agencies to come up with ways to further reduce violence against law enforcement, and orders a hard look at how the Department of Justice and other agencies use their law enforcement grants.  The second order establishes a task force, led by the new Attorney General, to reduce crime and restore public safety in communities across America.  Together, the members of this task force are going to come up with specific recommendations -- how we can change existing federal law to better prevent crime and improve public safety, and develop stronger working relationships with our state and local partners.  The President is confident that this task force will develop a systematic strategy to help further protect the American people. Communities across our nation have been devastated by a surge in violent-crime rates, particularly in our major cities.  Over the last eight years, we've experienced declining focus on law and order.  Crime reduction will clearly be a priority for this White House. The last executive order re-focuses the energy and resources of the federal government to dismantle transnational criminal organizations, such as drug cartels.  It's important to emphasize that we cannot reduce crime in the United States without additionally addressing illegal immigration and illegal drugs.  Through this executive order, the President instructs the Attorney General to form a comprehensive and decisive approach to destroying transnational crime organizations and drug cartels. These cartels represent a clear and present danger to our nation.  They bring dangerous criminals, drugs, and violence to once-peaceful neighborhoods both here at home and in other parts of the world.  They have fueled addiction and overdose deaths, and they can no longer be allowed to operate with impunity in our country or our hemisphere. This order pulls together the experience and resources of federal agencies to work towards emphasizing specific goals in this regard.  Number one, to upgrade our information-gathering about these transnational organizations and cartels.  Without accurate information about these threats, and the ability and willingness to share this information, we're not going to be able to tackle this problem.   It's important to note that, prior to this administration, if you had called the Department of Justice to ask for these statistics, they never kept them.  So knowing what we're facing is a big part of addressing the problem. Number two, improving the speed and efficiency of removing criminal aliens, cartel members, and people who help cartels from our nation.  Unlike during the last eight years, these criminals are finally going to go home. Three, shift whatever resources we can to tackling these organizations and prevent them from disrupting our society any further. Now, on to the President’s schedule.  This morning, the President held a breakfast and listening session with key stakeholders in the airline industry.  We've got a participant list if you're interested.  The President thanked the attendees for the 10 million jobs and $1 trillion in annual economic activity they contribute to our economy, and praised them for moving approximately 2 million passengers per day in spite of the outdated infrastructure and equipment that they have in terms of air traffic control and other infrastructure measures. The President asked the aviation leaders what the government can do to help their industry grow and create more well-paying jobs for Americans.  The leaders commented that they had never been given the opportunity to truly work alongside the President in such an open and constructive way.  And they were unanimous in asking for the President to offer relief from the duplicative and burdensome regulations that are stifling job creation, which he assured them he'd do. The President also reaffirmed his commitment to foregoing -- to forging, rather, public-private partnerships that will rebuild America’s crumbling infrastructure.  He pledged to work closely with the airline industry to modernize the technology systems that keep our nation’s airports running, and to expedite the approval process for future airline infrastructure projects.  It's the President’s goal to make sure the United States has the most advanced airline system in the world, and this meeting was an important first step in achieving that. After the executive order signing, the President spoke with the President of Afghanistan and the Emir of Qatar.  My understanding is that we should have readouts shortly on both of those calls.   Just concluding, a few moments ago the President held a Supreme Court and legislative listening session and lunch with Democratic and Republican senators.  In attendance were Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa; Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota; Senator Tester of Montana; Senator Donnelly of Indiana; Senator Manchin of West Virginia; Senator Moore Capito, also of West Virginia; Senator Cornyn of Texas; Senator Alexander Of Tennessee; Senator Coons of Delaware, and Senator Bennet of Colorado. The President expressed his hope that these senators and their colleagues will give Judge Gorsuch a fair consideration and vote based on his qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court.  With over 100 federal judicial nominations potentially happening during this administration, it's critical for us to have open dialogue and work towards bipartisan agreement so that our justice system returns to its important work on behalf of the American people. Later today, the President will speak with the Emir of Kuwait and the Prime Minister of Iraq.  He will provide readouts -- or we will provide readouts of those calls moving towards the conclusion of them. We also anticipate that the Senate will hold a vote to confirm Secretary-designate Price this evening or into the early hours of Friday to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services. The President was glad to see that the Army Corps of Engineers announced last night the final easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline.  With this final federal authorization completed, and the President working to reduce further unnecessary delays, this infrastructure project can finally continue to move forward.  The construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline was one of the President’s campaign promises and the subject of one of his first executive orders.  The administration is pleased that Americans will be going to work building this pipeline, and building it with American steel whenever possible. Now, looking to the upcoming schedule.  Tomorrow, the President will welcome Prime Minister Abe of Japan.  The President and the Prime Minister will hold a press conference at 1:00 p.m. in the East Room.  They will depart Washington around 3:00 tomorrow afternoon for Mar-A-Lago, where the President is honored to host the Prime Minister at the Winter White House. As we recently announced just earlier today, Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada will visit the White House on Monday.  The President looks forward to a constructive conversation and strengthening the deep relationship that exists between the United States and Canada.  The President will also host Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel next Wednesday.  We’ll have further guidance on the press availability potentials for either one of those.   One last thing before I take your questions, amid surging levels of CEO confidence and in the wake of the incredible jobs announcement made at the White House yesterday by Intel, there's also new numbers released today by the Department of Labor showing that unemployment claims are at near historic lows. The President knows better than anyone what businesses need to create jobs, and the market is responding to his policy improvements.  This administration will continue to roll back burdensome regulations and lower the overall tax burden on Americans so they can hire even more people and create even more innovative projects.  With that, I’ll take your questions.  Kaitlan Collins. Q    Thank you.  Hundreds of bureaucrats at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau make more than members of Congress.  Forty of them make more than Vice President Mike Pence.  Does the President have plans to revamp this agency?  And if so, does he feel that he should be able to fire the head of the agency at his will? MR. SPICER:  I think I've addressed this before, but we have no updates right now on the head of CFPB.  If we do, I’ll let you know. With respect to the first part of that question, I think one of the things that you’re going to continue to see from this President is a respects for taxpayers’ dollars, the money they spend, and how they’re spent.  We are going to continue to review all aspects of government.  I think you’ll see further announcements as far as how he’s going to look at -- how he’s going to approach and innovate and update government.   The bottom line is that we should be paying people a fair wage for their service to this country, but that we should doing it in the most effective and efficient manner.  And I think that’s what the President has already shown towards his commitment towards helping reduce the cost of several programs through the government and bringing back jobs.  But there’s going to be a respect for taxpayers in this administration, so that whether it's salaries or actual positions or programs, he’s going to have a very, very tough look at how we’re operating government, how many positions they're in, what people are getting paid.   But the President understands that most Americans are out there working night and day trying to get by, and that Washington truly needs to respect the money that they spend, and that we should be doing it in a way that shows that -- with a level of respect in terms of how many people are hiring, what they’re paid, what programs we’re looking at, whether or not that program is duplicative.  But it’s not just about one department or one agency.  It’s really about looking at how government as a whole operates. John. Q    Sean, questions have been raised after Kellyanne Conway did an interview, I believe it was with Fox News this morning, where she appeared to, from the confines of the Brady Briefing room, promote the products of Ivanka Trump.  Do you believe that she crossed an ethical line? MR. SPICER:  Kellyanne has been counseled and that’s all we’re going to go with.  She’s been counseled on that subject, and that’s it. Q    And could I ask a question.  Reuters has a story out that includes a partial transcript of the President’s call with Vladimir Putin, in which he appears to express doubts about the New START Treaty.  Does he indeed have doubts about the New START Treaty?  Would he like to see that renegotiated? MR. SPICER:  The President’s conversation with President Putin is a private call between the two of them, and I’m going to leave it at that.  We put a readout on the call, and we have nothing further beyond that. John Gizzi. Q    Thank you, Sean.  One question today. MR. SPICER:  Wow.   Q    (Laughter.)  On February 2nd, Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a well-known filmmaker in Russia and was a close associate of the late Boris Nemtsov, the dissident, found himself in critical condition.  His wife has since said she believes this is poisoning, very much like the conditions that almost took his life two years ago.  And does the administration have any comment about that, or the frustration of Mr. Navalny, the opponent of President Putin to get on the ballot as a candidate? MR. SPICER:  I think our State Department is aware of the situation, we’re monitoring it, and I’ll leave it at that. Blake. Q    Sean, the President said today in the airlines representative meeting that he hopes to have an announcement within the next two to three weeks about lowering the burden of taxes for businesses.  At the Super Bowl interview, he was asked, can Americans expect a tax break in 2017, and he said, ""I think so, yes.  I would like to say yes.""  It sounds like he’s a little bit more confident for the businesses than individual tax breaks for Americans.  Is the business component at this point ahead of the individual component?   MR. SPICER:  No, it’s a comprehensive -- yeah -- thanks for asking.  I think we’re looking at, in the next few weeks, rolling out the outline of a comprehensive tax plan that we’ll be working with Congress on that will address both the business side of the tax ledger as well as the individual rates.  But it’s going to be a comprehensive plan, something that we haven’t seen since 1986. But I think when you look at the segueing of that, we’ve got two opportunities for reconciliation this year.  One is using the FY17 budget, which you can easily get Obamacare repeal and replace done, and then you can use the FY18 budget to utilize the second opportunity at reconciliation to do comprehensive reform.  But we recognize the need.  I mean, it’s been since 1986 that something like this, of this scale and magnitude, had happened.   The President recognizes that middle-class Americans need tax relief, and that’s going to be part of that.  But we also recognize -- and you saw that in all of these businesses meetings, whether it’s inversions or other means in which people are shipping jobs overseas or reestablishing themselves or the profits that are kept over there -- we need fundamental, comprehensive tax reform that addresses both sides of that income stream.   Q    Can you say if this is going to be a mix between what he had put out there on the campaign and what House Republicans had put out there before?  Because there’s some similarities but clearly some differences as well. MR. SPICER:  I’m just going to say that you're going to have to wait a couple weeks before we put out that outline.  But I can tell you that it’s something that is going to spur economic growth.  It’s going to recognize the need to give so many working Americans the relief that they need.  But more importantly, I think part of the issue that we continue to see over and over again with businesses is that we're facing competition from abroad because of our tax code.  It favors companies from not wanting to stay, and the President recognizes that.  And what he wants to do is create a tax climate that not only keeps jobs here but makes it -- incentivizes companies to want to come here, to grow here, to create jobs here, to bring their profits back here.   So I think -- I don't want to get any further ahead of it, but I will tell you that it is going to be the first time that this nation has seen a full comprehensive tax reform in a long, long time. Yes. Q    Yes, the President this morning tweeted that our country is “bogged down in conflict all over the place.”  Where are we bogged down? MR. SPICER:  I think there are several places that we've been --  Q    What does he mean by that? MR. SPICER:  I think that if you look at ISIS in particular and the hotspots around the country, the places that we have to monitor, there's a lot of countries through the Middle East in particular -- Northern Africa -- that we are having to address and deal with and monitor because of the threat of radical Islamic terrorism.   There's no question that the spread of it has gone -- in the last eight years has proliferated.  And I think that the resources that we have to spend -- this isn’t a traditional war where you're just looking at the other enemy with a uniform and saying, here’s the country we're fighting.  The proliferation of ISIS throughout this country has made it so that we have to focus a lot more in a lot more places and expend a lot more resources because it’s more of a disparate approach that we have to employ, as opposed to having one country that you're facing at one time. Q    But “bogged down” suggests it’s something we can't get out of? MR. SPICER:  I just answered the question.  I understand. Q    Thank you, Sean.  And happy Lantern Festival to you.   MR. SPICER:  Happy Lantern Festival to you. Q    Thank you.  Regarding the very nice letter that President Trump sent to President Xi Jinping last night, I’m curious about the timing.  And also in the letter, President Trump said he’s looking forward to the event of constructive relationship with China.  So could you elaborate the importance of this bilateral relationship to the U.S.? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think it’s obviously important to us.  And the President understands that.  I think he’s spoken fairly often about China, and he understands both the national and economic interests that we have, the desire for our companies to access the Chinese market, but also the national security interests that we have.  And so he obviously wants to do what he can to have a fruitful and constructive relationship with China, and he looks forward to developing that as we go forward. Sarah. Q    Sean, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said today that they could use a few thousand more troops in Afghanistan to help the coalition efforts there.  Going off Mike’s question, if we're trying to get out of conflicts like that, does the administration plan to send those additional forces to Afghanistan?  MR. SPICER:  I think the President will heed the advice of the generals and Secretary Mattis.  That conversation has yet to happen -- and if we have any further announcements.  But I think that's right now a Department of Defense issue that you should raise with. Hallie. Q    Sean, two questions for you.  I want to get to one on immigration.  But first on the comments from Judge Gorsuch that have been reported out, I just have a two-parter.  But does the President still stand by his nomination? MR. SPICER:  Absolutely. Q    Given where Gorsuch stands --  MR. SPICER:  That's number one? Q    No, the second part of a two-part.   MR. SPICER:  Oh.  (Laughter.)   Q    Given where --  MR. SPICER:  I’m not calling on you anymore.   Q    Given Judge Gorsuch’s position on the President’s attitude toward the judiciary, and given that the President has praised Neil Gorsuch for his intellect and for his integrity, does the President have any regrets about the comments that he’s made about federal judges? MR. SPICER:  I think the President’s comments speak for -- no, he has no regrets.  But he’s very proud of the selection that he’s made, and he’s going to make a great associate justice to the Supreme Court. Q    Now about the selection, but about the comments that he said, for example, about Judge -- MR. SPICER:  I understand that, I just -- he has no regrets.  Thank you. Q    On immigration, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos -- MR. SPICER:  Look what you started, April Ryan. Q    Why are you calling me out?  I didn’t do anything.  (Laughter.)   Q    I know the White House, I'm sure, has been following the situation of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos.  And so I want to know, does the President believe she should have been deported?  And what message does he have to others in her position? MR. SPICER:  Yeah, I’m going to refer you back to ICE on that.  That’s an ICE matter.  Q    The President has no comment? MR. SPICER:  The issue is developing in Arizona right now, and I would refer you back to ICE. Margaret.  Q    She’s in Mexico right now, though. MR. SPICER:  I’d refer you back to ICE. Q    Sean, in that lunch meeting, the President said that -- he basically said Senator Blumenthal’s comments were taken out of context, and that -- MR. SPICER:  Well, no, Judge Gorsuch’s comments were -- yeah. Q    Judge Gorsuch, right.  And that his relaying of Judge Gorsuch’s comments were taken out of context.  However, Senator Ayotte, who is working with the White House to help shepherd Judge Gorsuch through the Hill, released a statement confirming those same remarks, “disheartening” and “demoralizing.”   MR. SPICER:  Right, so here’s what -- Q    Is the President aware of that?  Because she was in that meeting. MR. SPICER:  No, no, of course he’s aware.  This is what Senator Ayotte said:  ""Judge Gorsuch has made it very clear in all of his discussions with senators, including Senator Blumenthal, that he could not comment on [any] specific cases, and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters.  He has also emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary, and while he made clear that he was not referencing* [referring to] any specific case, he said that he finds any criticism of a judge’s integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.” So there is a big difference between commenting on the specific comments that had been made in the tweet and his general philosophy about the judiciary and his respect for his fellow judges.  And I think the senator’s comments were very clear about how those are two distinct issues. Q    Right.  And the judge’s comments as relayed through others were also in that context of the President’s attacks on the judiciary, which is what the senator you just read out was also talking about there.  MR. SPICER:  Right. Q    Was the President aware of that?  Because Senator Ayotte was sitting right across from him when he said that those comments were inaccurately reported or conveyed. MR. SPICER:  No, the way that Senator Blumenthal characterized them, he was talking about the tweets and saying that he was disheartened.  That’s not what the judge said.  He was making two very complete, distinct arguments about how he views the comments that he should not be commenting on a political matter or on specific things. But as a whole, he doesn’t like attacks in general on the judiciary.  It was a very distinct argument that he was making.  And I think that that’s where I think we’ve got to be clear, and that’s what Senator Ayotte was saying this morning.  Very, very different.   Cecilia.   Q    Is he to take that on board?  I mean --  MR. SPICER:  Is he what? Q    Is he taking that on board?  I mean, you just said he doesn’t regret his past attacks on the judiciary.   MR. SPICER:  Right. Q    But now you have these confirmed remarks, which you were saying were exactly what the judge was talking about. MR. SPICER:  No, no --  Q    And that’s not changing the President’s own -- MR. SPICER:  But hold on -- but, again, I think it’s important to understand that the judge was very clear that he was not commenting on any specific matter, right?  And then the he was asked about his general philosophy.  So you can’t then take that -- equate it back to the specific.  He literally went out of his way to say, I’m not commenting on a specific instance.  So to take what he said about a generalization and apply it to a specific is exactly what he was intending not to do. Q    In other words, the President will continue to speak like this. MR. SPICER:  Of course he will.  The President is going to speak his mind.  It goes back to Thomas Jefferson, that Presidents have commented on judicial nominees.  I mean, the idea of one branch talking about or commenting on another branch is as old as our republic.   So I don’t know why -- and I find it interesting when President Obama criticized the Supreme Court for its Citizens United comments in the State of the Union, there wasn’t a similar concern about that.  The idea that this is -- Q    Well, I guess the ""so-called judge"" portion of it, the personal attack. MR. SPICER:  But at some point it seems like there is clearly a double standard when it’s -- how this is applied.  When President Obama did it, there was no concern from this briefing room.  When he does it, it’s a ton of outrage. So I just -- with all due respect, I think the President has made very clear that he was concerned about how that executive order in particular, which is what we’re talking about, was applied.  And I think we’ve addressed it from this briefing room over and over and over again that the U.S. code gives the President very clear authority to make this happen. Cecilia. Q    I want to make sure I understand what you’re saying.  Are you saying that “demoralizing” and “disheartening” was not specifically about the President’s comments and what he said?  And if so, how does the President know that?  Has he spoken to the Judge? MR. SPICER:  No, I think the Judge literally made it very clear in his comments. Q    But three senators have come out and said that they corroborate that statement, and said that --  MR. SPICER:  I understand that.  Senator Ayotte, who was there, made it very clear that he was commenting in general about attacks on the judiciary.  That was it.  Plain and simple. Q    But three other senators have said, and the spokesman and for the Judge, on the record.    MR. SPICER:  I understand that, Cecilia.  I can tell you that Senator Ayotte, who has been with him on every single thing, was very clear about that.  There’s no -- so I understand that.  And that is -- she has made it very clear over and over again. Yes. Q    Sean, your answer about the context doesn't make sense when you think about what Senator Ben Sasse said today and this morning on TV.  He said that he asked Judge Gorsuch specifically about the President’s “so-called judge” tweet.  And in response --  MR. SPICER:  Phil, this is like the fourth time I’ve asked and answered. Q    No, but this is a different context, Sean.  MR. SPICER:  I understand that.  Phil, I have asked -- Q    This is directly about the President's tweet. MR. SPICER:  I understand that.  And I’ve said exactly what Senator Ayotte said about it.  I don't know how many times you guys -- Q    But her comment was only about Blumenthal. MR. SPICER:  I understand, thank you.  Q    Sean, I'm going to continue on this line, despite what was just happening there.  Why isn’t the White House, why isn’t the President concerned about the influence or the appearance of the influence on the independent judiciary?  MR. SPICER:  Why isn’t he -- I mean, he is free to speak his mind.  Where has this outrage been for the last hundred years?  There has been --  Q    I'm not asking about the Obama administration or any previous administration, I’m talking about this President and this White House. MR. SPICER:  I understand that.  And the President has -- part of the reason the President got elected is because he speaks his mind.  He doesn't hold it back.  He’s authentic.  And he’s not going to sit back, I think, when he feels very passionately about something as much as the executive order. He was doing it to make sure Americans were safe.  The order -- the U.S. code is crystal-clear on this.  I think I’ve read it for like three days in a row.  And it can't be any clearer how much authority it gives the President to do what he can to keep us safe.  He’s concerned that he’s doing what he can to keep this country safe, and there has been a lot of activity to stand in the way.   So I’m not sure how many more times I can read the code to you.  But 8 U.S. Code, 1182 --  Q    Yes, but you and me talking about it is not how the judicial process works. MR. SPICER:  Thank you.  You've asked the question now eight times. Q    One more I’d like to ask you.  One more about a different set of comments. MR. SPICER:  You've got -- hold on.  I understand.   Thank you, go ahead. Q    About a different set of comments that have been made, Sean, also from Kellyanne Conway earlier this week. Q    Let him go.  Let him go. Q    Earlier this week.  You say the -- this is in context of Nordstrom and not about what she was counseled about, but about something she said to CNN earlier this week, is that the President doesn't comment on everything.  And so I want to contrast the President’s repeated statements about Nordstrom with the lack of comments about some other things, including, for example, the attack on a Quebec mosque and other similar environments.  Why is the President -- when he chooses to --  MR. SPICER:  Do you -- hold on -- because you just brought that up.  I literally stand at this podium and opened a briefing a couple days ago about the President expressing his condolences.  I literally opened the briefing about it.  So for you to sit there and say --  Q    I was here.   MR. SPICER:  I know.  So why are you asking why he didn't do it when I literally stood here and did it? Q    The President’s statement -- MR. SPICER:  I don't understand what you're asking. Q    Kellyanne’s comments were about that the President doesn't have time to tweet about everything.  MR. SPICER:  Right.  Q    He’s tweeting about this. MR. SPICER:  Right.  Q    He’s not tweeting about something else. MR. SPICER:  I came out here and actually spoke about it and said the President spoke -- Q    I'm talking about the President’s time.  MR. SPICER:  What are you -- you're equating me addressing the nation here and a tweet?  I don't -- that's the silliest thing I’ve ever heard.   Q    I’m talking about an attack on Nordstrom on --  MR. SPICER:  Okay, I’m done.  This is silly.  Okay, next.   Q    -- and an attack on people, and you're equating -- MR. SPICER:  Thank you.  You've asked your question.  Thank you.  Q    Does that not diminish the language that you're using? MR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Go ahead. Q    Thank you, Sean.  One of the criticisms leveled at President Trump’s predecessor, President Obama, by Republicans was his excessive use of executive orders.  The President signed three more executive orders today.  Why isn’t that criticism applicable to President Trump in the same manner that President Obama --   MR. SPICER:  I think when you look at the context of what they -- yes, what those executive orders did, and there’s things that are within the bounds of trying to protect this country and ordering police officers -- nothing that I think even Democrats would complain, with the exception of the one that we've had conversations on.  Most of them have been widely praised by both parties to keep this country safe, to get jobs creation back.  Most of them have widely applauded.   I think the difference with what President Obama did was stretch the executive order to take actions that had largely been within the realm of Congress, and to do things that didn't allow for prior input.  The stuff that the President is doing is almost entirely highly applauded by both sides of the aisle and won tremendous praise.  There's a big difference in the context in which those two administrations operated.   Q    One of the criticisms in addition to that was that President Obama in using those EOs was governing by executive fiat, he wasn’t working with Congress.  Does the President plan to use -- MR. SPICER:  Right.  But again, I think -- Q    -- Congress in a legislative manner? MR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  And I just mentioned both tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare -- immigration.  There are so many areas where the President -- he literally just -- we held up this briefing a little so that eight United States senators could walk out and talk about -- and again, that meeting, while it was focused on the judiciary, they talked about infrastructure.  They talked about other priorities that they have.   He has shown a commitment to work across the aisle to bring folks in, to listen, to hear their thoughts, to get ideas on a legislative agenda that they can move together with.  So I think there is a big difference between the last administration that sort of shunned Congress’s role, and this administration where the President is actively seeking their input and ideas, and helping them craft an agenda to move the country forward. Alexis. Q    Can I follow up on the tax question? MR. SPICER:  Sure. Q    Because there are revenue elements of the Affordable Care Act, if it is repealed and replaced -- there has been discussion on the Hill about what would be the appropriate track to get that into tax legislation or how to treat the tax legislation.  If the President is interested in unveiling a tax package that is as comprehensive as you just described, would the revenue elements of the Affordable Care Act be on a separate track?  Or is he talking about folding them into one reconciliation package? MR. SPICER:  So right now, as I mentioned at the outset, I think we're primarily looking at two reconciliation tracks -- one utilizing the 2017 budget.  So you could put your Obamacare repeal and replace in the 2017 reconciliation package, and then you could potentially do tax reform -- comprehensive tax reform in the 2018 budget. But I also want to say -- just so we're clear, these aren't prescriptive.  I think we continue to work towards Congress on a range of options and ideas to accomplish both of those and other goals.  Those seem primarily the two most opportune ways to get this thing done.  But I wouldn’t want to rule in or anything out. I think both Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell are going to weigh in on what best vehicles can be utilized to make this thing happen.  So I don't want to be prescriptive. Ben. Q    You talked about the President’s tax reform plan in coming weeks.  Is that something he’s talked about with leaders in both houses of Congress?  And are they prepared for this? MR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  I mean, as I mentioned, he has met with -- just wrapped up a meeting with Republicans and Democratic senators.  But this is something that the legislative affairs team, as well as the President himself has engaged with members of Congress to talk about this both privately and in bigger groups.  But there is a very large conversation going on to achieve bipartisan support for a package of this nature. Jonathan. Q    Does the President believe that it’s possible to balance the budget without major entitlement reform?  Any sort of House -- MR. SPICER:  I think one of the things that the President has looked at is not just the cutting side, but the revenue stream.  One area in particular -- natural resources regulation and tax reform, how we can grow the economy and bring in additional revenues to the government on the revenue side.  So there is a balance to how the President is looking at bringing down the deficit. And I think before I get -- he’s going to -- we’ll have a budget out in a few weeks.  I think that will answer a lot.  But again, when it comes to deficit reduction, which is something that he is very interested in, that is not a one-side-of-the-ledger option; that a lot of what he is trying to talk about in these meetings and with business executives is how we can expand the economy.  And that expanded economy, that job creation, those explorations of natural resources and additional new jobs also bring additional tax revenue in.   So there's a way to do this.  If we start bringing businesses back, creating more things, creating more jobs, that creates a revenue stream that has a significant impact on the deficit -- on being able to drive down the deficit and balancing the budget.  So I think it’s not something I want to get in too much detail now, but I will tell you that I think the President has been very, very keen on trying to make sure that we look at the revenue side as much as we're looking at the spending side. When it comes to the spending side, again, you're looking at a whole-of-government approach at how we look at every department, every agency, every job, the spending -- or the hiring freeze being one of them.  How do we make sure that we're looking at are these positions necessary?  Are they duplicative?  Are we using taxpayer money in the best possible way?   Those are the whole -- it isn’t a single -- like, look at those particular programs and try to figure out what we can do.  He’s looking at everything and figuring out if we can make it more effective and efficient. Yes, Scott. Q    Yes, Sean, Monday, the House Oversight Committee is going to mark up Congressman Chaffetz’s bill to strike down the District of Columbia's Death with Dignity Act, the assisted suicide law.  It could soon come to the White House.  Has the President articulated any thoughts on that or the other bills to strike down D.C.’s gun laws, marijuana, funding for federal -- for abortions in the District?  Any thoughts on all these things that are coming your way? MR. SPICER:  As they come our way and they get passed by both houses and come this way, we will issue statements of administration policy.  At this time, they are not at that position.   So thank you, guys, very much.  We’ll see you tomorrow with the Prime Minister.  Take care. Q    On Mar-a-Lago -- Q    One question. Q    Come back. MR. SPICER:  Sorry, one quick one.  On Mar-a-Lago, someone asked about it yesterday, so a quick follow-up.  The President has offered as a gift to the Prime Minister, he will be his guest at Mar-a-Lago.  No one else will be staying there, as far as I know, from the Japanese delegation.  They will stay out in town with the rest of the staff.  But that is a gift that the President is extending to the Prime Minister.

Brady Press Briefing Room  12:32 P.M. EST MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  Happy Groundhog Day.  We've got six more weeks of winter, apparently.  Luckily, for those of you who are going to be joining the President down to Florida this weekend, you'll get some time to get a glimpse of summer at the ""Winter White House"" in Mar-a-Lago. The President is going to start his meeting at 1:00 sharp.  You probably just saw the b-roll of folks from Harley rolling on in, literally.  So I’m going to try to keep this a little quick. The President signed a proclamation yesterday ushering in Black History Month.  He looks forward to an engaging and informative month of events honoring the enormous contributions that African Americans have made throughout our history. Last night, the President was honored to host the swearing-in of the next Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in the Oval Office.  As the President said last night, Secretary Tillerson is a man who’s already respected all over the world for the tremendous life that he’s led, and now will bring his years of experience to the critical task of making our nation safer, more prosperous, and more secure.  It’s time to bring a clear-eyed focus to our foreign affairs, and now with Secretary Tillerson at the helm of the State Department, we’ll do just that.  We'll strengthen our alliances, form new ones, and enhance America’s interests throughout the world.  Speaking of the President’s excellent nominees, praise is pouring in from around the country for his pick for Supreme Court.  The Detroit News said Judge Gorsuch is a “legal superstar""; “an outstanding choice,” says the New Hampshire Union Leader.  The Richmond Times-Dispatch says the “initial reaction” was “to cheer.”  The South Florida Sun Sentinel touted his “excellent qualifications.” Yesterday, Judge Gorsuch had his first round of meetings on the Hill.  Unfortunately, Senate offices aren’t in the habit of releasing editorials, but from everything we heard, the Judge knocked it out of the park on the Senate as well.  The President looks forward to a fair and speedy confirmation process for this exceedingly qualified nominee and jurist.    In my last briefing, I read out a list of the senators Judge Gorsuch met with.  In addition to the meeting with Majority Leader McConnell, Majority Whip Cornyn, Judiciary Chairman Grassley, and Senators Hatch and Gardner, the Judge also met with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia.  Recently, Senator Manchin expressed his belief that Judge Gorsuch could win enough Democrats to hit 60 votes.  I’ll agree with the Senator there on that one.  I mean, we have to have a few Trump-state Democrats who want to win re-election.  But, as I pointed out yesterday, this so-called 60 vote “standard” is simply not accurate.  Democrats are grasping at straws to block the confirmation of an unquestionably qualified nominee.  I’ll repeat, neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama put forward were subject to the 60-vote threshold.  So although I agree with Senator Manchin that Judge Gorsuch will probably get enough Democrats to get to 60, it’s just simply not ever been a requirement. Now, on to the events of today.  The President started his day by attending the National Prayer Breakfast.  It's a tradition that continued over six decades, going back to President Eisenhower.  The President thanked the American people for their faith and prayers that have sustained and inspired him, noting that the five words that he has heard more than any others as he’s traveled throughout the country are, “I'm praying for you.”  He spoke at length about the ISIS genocide against Christians and the oppression of peace-loving Muslims, as well as the threats of extermination against the Jewish people, and made it clear that he believes the United States has a moral obligation to speak out against such violence.  He encouraged Americans to remain a tolerant society where all faiths are respected and where all of our citizens can feel safe and secure.  With that goal in mind, the President remarked that he's taken action to ensure that the United States will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread throughout our nation.  In the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and reject any form of oppression or discrimination.  The President also committed to get rid of the Johnson Amendment and allowing our representatives of faith to speak freely and without retribution. In a particularly poignant moment during his remarks, the President recalled yesterday his visit to Dover Air Force Base to join the family of Chief Ryan Owens as America’s fallen hero was returned home.  After honoring Chief Owens for giving his life in defense of the American people, the President quoted John 15:13:  “Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends.” After returning to the White House this morning, the President held a legislative affairs staff meeting in the Oval Office with his team.  The team continues to work closely with Congress to enact the President’s agenda.  With the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, extensive outreach is underway on Capitol Hill and we look forward to the Judge receiving a swift and fair hearing. Between his meetings, the President was pleased to see that EPA Administrator-designee Pruitt was voted out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.  As has unfortunately become the practice, Democrats again boycotted the hearing, requiring a suspension of the rules in order to advance his nomination. Following the strategy session, the President met with Senators Hatch, Wyden and Congressmen Brady and Neal.  This meeting was an opportunity for the President to meet with the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee to help chart the future of U.S. trade policy.  The President has put together an all-star trade team that will work closely with the U.S. Trade Representative and the committees led by these members to craft new trade deals.   The President has expressed his concern time and again with NAFTA, which he believes is an out-of-date agreement.  The ultimate goal is to ensure the best and fairest treatment of U.S. workers and businesses, and the President believes that those interests are best secured by bilateral, rather than multilateral trade deals.  He looks forward to working closely with the USTR and Congress when it comes to issues of trade. For those of you who weren’t outside and just saw the Harleys roll up, it’s no surprise that this afternoon the President will host a meeting and listening session with Harley-Davidson executives and union representatives.  For a list of those individuals, please contact our office.  Harley-Davidson has been an American success story since 1901, when William S. Harley, at age 21, completed the blueprint drawing of an engine designed to fit into a bicycle.  In 1903, Harley-Davidson began building motorcycles in the United States. And today, the company has approximately 6,000 employees and $6 billion in annual revenue.  The company’s global headquarters is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- which may have had something to do with them getting in so quickly.  And there's a certain staffer. Today, the President will welcome to the White House the latest generation of Harley-Davidson executives to discuss how to make it easier for businesses to create more jobs and factories in the United States.  Beyond the company executives, representatives from the machinists and steel workers unions were also be in attendance. Their motorcycles have carried our American servicemembers in war.  They carry our police officers that keep us safe.  They carry the Secret Service as they protect our presidents.  And they bring joy to millions of Americans and throughout the world -- and others throughout the world, rather.  The President is looking forward to hosting these leaders from one of America’s truly great entrepreneurial success stories.  The American worker built this country, and the President is focused on restoring a government that puts their interests first.  A few administrative notes.  The National Security Advisor, Mike Flynn, today announced additions to the NSC senior staff.  David Cattler will be a Deputy Assistant to the President for Regional Affairs.  John Eisenberg, Deputy Assistant to the President, NSC Legal Advisor, and Department [Deputy] Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs.  Kevin Harrington, Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Planning.  And Kenneth Juster, Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs. Lastly, we had a great reaction to our Skype introduction seats yesterday.  I know we've had a tremendous amount of requests pouring in from around the country.  Please contact the press office if you know of any that has an interest in joining us in the future.   In terms of the schedule for tomorrow, the President will host a Strategic and Policy Forum.  Then, in the afternoon, the President will have lunch with General Flynn before departing down to Mar-a-Lago later in the day. With that, I’ll take some questions. Katie Pavlich. Q    Hi, Sean.  Thanks for the question.  Today, President Trump talked about Christian genocide at the National Prayer Breakfast, and last year the Obama State Department officially declared a genocide by ISIS against Christians and other minority and religious groups in the Middle East and North Africa.  Now that Rex Tillerson has been sworn in as the Secretary, what specifically is the administration planning to do to comply with the legal obligations of protecting these groups under the U.N. 1948 Treaty? MR. SPICER:  That's a great question.  I think Secretary Tillerson is learning his way around the building so far this morning.  He gave a great speech talking about his vision and goal for the State Department.  I think there will be further guidance coming out on that, Katie.  Right now, his job is to get in, get settled, talk to the employees, make sure they understood.   But back to the issue, obviously it’s important to President.  It was during -- throughout the campaign.  It’s something that he addressed this morning, and is something that he is committed to.  He talked about it in terms of the executive orders, and allowing Christian minorities in key countries seek asylum in the United States.  He recognizes that, in so many nations, these are the oppressed groups in accordance with how the U.N. defines refugees.  So I think you’ll see further guidance with that. Jennifer. Q    Thanks, Sean.  I have two questions, actually.  Today, the President renewed his promise to protect religious liberty, which he says is under threat.  Some Americans see religious liberty as code for discrimination.  Can you kind of give us a sense of how the President views this tension? MR. SPICER:  It’s an interesting question, because I do -- you know, this is something that comes up quite a bit.  I think there is a line.  We have freedom of religion in this country, and I think people should be able to practice their religion, express their religion, express areas of their faith without reprisal.  And I think that pendulum sometimes swings the other way in the name of political correctness.   And I think the President and the Vice President both understand that one of the things that makes our country and this democracy so great is our ability to express our religion, to believe in faith, to express it, and to live by it.  And that’s where I think the important part is -- whether it’s a small business owner or employee, he wants to have some degree of expression of faith at the company.  And too often those voices get pushed out in the name of political correctness.   So he’s going to continue to make sure that we not only speak up for it, but find ways in which we can keep that line a little less blurred and make sure that the pendulum doesn’t swing against people.  We shouldn’t impose a religion on anybody.  We’re free to express our religion or be -- you know, not have one.  That’s obviously, in our country, an equally valid way of living your life.  But at the same time, I think people who want to express their faith shouldn’t be ostracized because they want to live that.  Major. Q    If you could give us an example, if you could, of the pendulum swinging in the direction of political correctness.  And how is that going to inform the President with this executive order?  And as you may know, a draft is circulating around town and many have wondered if that is going to be a way to either silence those on the left or be a threat to the LGBTQ community.  Talk us through both of those. MR. SPICER:  Well, I think if you look back to the Little Sisters case, if you look back to other businesses that were, under Obamacare -- Q    Would you put Hobby Lobby in that category? MR. SPICER:  I would, yeah.  Absolutely.  I think there’s several businesses and several institutions -- Catholic institutions and others -- that have been mandated or attempted to mandate certain things that they may or may not do or how they have to treat their employees.  Those are instances where clearly the pendulum is swinging a different way, where you are not carving out institutions or the ability for privately held businesses to conduct themselves to live according to their faith or their moral compass.   And so there’s clearly a lot of evidence in the last couple years of the government coming in with regulations and policies that have, frankly, denied people the ability to live according to their faith. Q    From the President’s point of view, that’s discriminatory in itself. MR. SPICER:  Well, I think there’s -- like I said, I think it’s a pendulum.  And where the President is, is that he wants to make sure that you don’t penalize someone for wanting to express their faith, and that to the extent that we can keep that line a little less blurred and allow people who don’t believe in a faith or have an opposing faith, make sure that they are equally comfortable in the workplace.  But we shouldn’t penalize people or mandate them to abide by certain policies or regulations which are in direct contradiction to their faith. Q    And what about the executive order, Sean?   MR. SPICER:  There’s right now no executive orders that are official or able to read out.  We maintain that there’s nothing new on that front.   Q    (Inaudible) drafted along -- MR. SPICER:  It's not a question of -- there are a lot of ideas that are being floated out -- I mentioned this the last couple days.  But that doesn’t mean -- part of it is, as the President does all the time, he asks for input, he asks for ideas, and on a variety of subjects there are staffing procedures that go on where people have a thought or an idea and it goes through the process.  But until the President makes up his mind and gives feedback and decides that that’s final, there’s nothing to announce.  Q    Thank you.  In light of the tragedy that happened in Quebec City last week, which Prime Minister Trudeau is actually calling an act of terrorism, what is the President doing, what initiatives is he taking to make sure that that kind of homegrown -- because he was a Canadian citizen -- homegrown terrorism, homegrown violence doesn’t happen within our country? MR. SPICER:  Well, there’s a lot of things.  Number one, he’s talked cyber -- I mean, he’s looking at it from every angle.  I think the first thing is to make sure that we look at our borders.  You’ve got to protect your own people first, then you’ve got to look at the cyber threats.  I mean, so there is a holistic approach to both immigration and there’s a direct nexus between immigration and national security and personal security that he has to look at.   But then it’s a multi-tiered step.  You look at the borders, you look at who we’re letting in, and you also look at what we’re doing internally with our intelligence agencies and the FBI that make sure that we’re looking at -- whether it’s the cyber threats that we face or other terrorist activities -- but making sure that we’re working with the NSA and the FBI to be ahead of the curve, if you will. Q    If I may, these are homegrown -- Oklahoma City was an American kid. MR. SPICER:  Sure. Q    Okay.  That’s all.  That’s what I’m asking. MR. SPICER:  That’s what I’m saying.  But I think that, part of it is, looking at using the assets that we have here -- the NSA, the FBI -- looking at using the different agencies to see if we can get ahead of the curve and see things.  And a lot of times, that’s been a very big issue, is getting ahead of the curve for when there are telltale signs, having the reporting systems up, working with the various agencies.  But it’s a multi-effort process, if you will. Kristen. Q    Sean, thank you.  Why is the administration easing sanctions against Russia? MR. SPICER:  We’re not easing sanctions.  The Treasury Department -- it is, from what I understand, it’s a fairly common practice for the Treasury Department, after sanctions are put in place, to go back and to look at whether or not there needs to be specific carve-outs for either industries or products and services that need to be going back and forth.  But I would refer you back to the Treasury Department on that one. Q    Hold on, Sean.  The language on the Treasury Department website suggests that you are, in fact, easing sanctions that authorizes certain transactions with the Federal Security Service.  Does that not suggest a shift from what was put in place --  MR. SPICER:  No, it doesn’t.   Q    So explain --  MR. SPICER:  It is, from what I understand, a regular course of action.  The Treasury does, quite often, when there are sanction imposed, but I would refer you back to the Treasury Department. Q    Thank you.  Could I ask you to describe the tone of the call on the weekend between the Australian Prime Minister and the President, and also outline the President’s concerns about the refugee deal in question?  And I asked you this earlier this week, but could you clarify whether the deal is on or not?  Because the President tweeted last night “I will study this dumb deal,"" implying that he's still considering it.   MR. SPICER:  Right.  The President had a very cordial conversation with Prime Minister Turnbull, where they went through an extensive discussion of this deal.  The President is unbelievably disappointed in the previous administration’s deal that was made and how poorly it was crafted, and the threat to national security it put the United States on. He has tremendous respect for the Prime Minister and for the Australian people, and has agreed to continue to review that deal and to ensure that as part of the deal, which was always part of it, that we would go through a very, very extreme vetting process to ensure that every single person that is being offered up is coming here with peaceful intentions and poses no threat to the United States.  So he has ensured that while he has respect for the Australian people and respect for Prime Minister Turnbull, that we do not pose a threat to the United States of America, that the deal that was cut by the last administration is something that he is extremely, extremely upset with.  He does not like it, but out of respect for him, he’s going to allow that process -- continue to study it and allow it to move forward under the conditions that have been set -- that there will be extreme vetting on every single one of those individuals. Q    Just for clarity, the deal itself is still under review, so it’s not certain to proceed?  Or it will proceed as --  MR. SPICER:  Part of the deal was that -- the deal allows for the United States to vet the individuals that are being offered up to be processed.  The President’s goal is to make sure that every single one of those people, in accordance with the deal and as discussed in the telephone conversation with the Prime Minister, is subject to extreme vetting to ensure that no one puts it.  But I cannot underscore how disappointed he was in the deal that was made and how he thought it was just a horrible deal that was offered up by the United States by the previous administration. Sarah. Q    The President and his national security advisor have been clear the administration wants to put Iran “on notice,” but they haven’t specified what that is.  What options are on the table?  And are there any options, like military action, that might be off the table at this point? MR. SPICER:  So I think General Flynn was really clear yesterday that Iran has violated the Joint Resolution, that Iran’s additional hostile actions that it took against our Navy vessel are ones that we are very clear are not going to sit by and take.  I think that we will have further updates for you on those additional actions, but clearly we wanted to make sure that Iran understood that they are on notice, this is not going un-responded to. John. Q    Thank you very much, Sean.   Q    It was a Saudi vessel.   MR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Yes. Q    They thought it was an American, but it's a Saudi vessel. MR. SPICER:  Right, that’s right.  John. Q    Thank you, Sean.  On January 27th, at the Republican retreat in Philadelphia, Vice President Pence had a closed-door meeting with House Republicans where several of them brought up the case of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.  There was an attempt to impeach him last year, which some of the leadership in the House felt was unfair to the commissioner, and they urged him to tell the President that given his entire record, he should fire him or ask for his resignation soon.  My sources said the Vice President said “I can hear you.”  Is there any pending action on the fate of Commissioner Koskinen? MR. SPICER:  I have nothing to update you on.   Hallie. Q    On Yemen, it was initially described, the raid over the weekend, as a successful raid by the administration.  There are now some questions and comments raised about the possibility of additional civilian casualties.  So I’ve got a couple of questions for you on this one.  Would you still stand by your characterization of the raid as “successful”?  Was the President given multiple options about this raid, or just one?  And were there consultations with the prior administration’s national security officials, military officials about the raid moving forward? MR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Actually, I’d like to just walk through that.  I appreciate you bringing this up. There is -- let’s go through the tick-tock on that raid.  On November 7th, CENTCOM submitted the plan to DOD.  Clearly, that was under the last administration.  Legal teams were involved immediately when it was submitted to DOD.  On December 19th, the plan was approved by the Department of Defense and recommended that it be moved ahead.  It was sent then to the National Security Council staff here in the White House.  Again, this all happened under the previous administration. On January 6th, there was an interagency deputies meeting.  The deputies recommended at that time that they go ahead.  It was so easily approved it was sent straight up.  The conclusion to hold was, at that time, to hold for what they called a “moonless night,” which, by calendar, wouldn’t occur until then-President-elect Trump was President Trump. On January 24th, shortly after taking office, Secretary of Defense-then Mattis read the memo, resent it back up to the White House conveying his support.  On the 25th of January, the President was briefed by General Flynn on Secretary Mattis’s recommendation and the status of the operation, or potential operation. The President asked to see Secretary Mattis and Joint Chiefs of Staff Dunford.  He then, on that evening, had a dinner meeting, which included the President, the Vice President, Secretary Mattis, Chairman Dunford, Chief of Staff Priebus, Jared Kushner, Chief Strategist Bannon, General Kellogg, General Flynn, and CIA Director Pompeo where the operation was laid out in great extent.  The indication at that time was to go ahead on Friday the 26th.   In the morning, the deputies committee met again.  It was not a necessary step because they had previously recommended and also reaffirmed their support for that.  On January 26th, the President signed the memo authorizing the action.   So it was a very -- not only was it a very, very though-out process by this administration, it had started back on November 7th in terms of -- clearly well before that, but it was a move forward by CENTCOM on November 7th.  This was a very, very well thought-out and executed effort. Q    Where was the President the night of the raid?  How did he learn about Chief Owens’s death?  And do you still stand by your characterization that it was successful?   MR. SPICER:  The President was here in the residence.  He was kept in touch with his national security staff.  Secretary Mattis and others had kept him updated on both the raid and the death of Chief Owens, as well as the four other individuals that were injured.  So he was kept apprised of the situation throughout the evening.   And again, I think -- I would go back to what I said yesterday:  It’s hard to ever call something a complete success when you have the loss of life, or people injured.  But I think when you look at the totality of what was gained to prevent the future loss of life here in America and against our people and our institutions, and probably throughout the world in terms of what some of these individuals could have done, I think it is a successful operation by all standards. And again, I want to reiterate, it is tough to ever use the word ""success"" when you know that somebody has lost their life.  But when you go back and look at an individual that dedicated their life to serving this country, and went over and over and over again knowing that this not only the risk that he took but wanted to do it because he knew the threat that these kind of individuals pose to our country and to our people, that's -- while not a success that you lost to him, you know that he died in sacrifice for someone else here in this nation. Hunter Walker.   Q    Thank you, Sean.  I’ve seen some criticism of the President’s remarks at the prayer breakfast this morning.  Can you shed any light on why he thought that was a good venue to mock “The Apprentice” for its ratings? MR. SPICER:  Look, Mark Burnett, the creator of “The Apprentice,” who is a long-time supporter of the prayer breakfast but also has a personal relationship, was there.  He meant it as a light-hearted moment.  And I think if you look at the totality of his remarks, they were absolutely beautiful.  And I think to hone in on that, it was a light-hearted moment he was trying to have with a big supporter of the National Prayer Breakfast and a personal friend. Guys, I’ll be out tomorrow.  I want to make sure we all get to see the President now.  Thank you, guys. END   12:57 P.M.

In later years, he was referred to as the ""Father of the Constitution."" At his inauguration, James Madison, a small, wizened man, appeared old and worn; Washington Irving described him as ""but a withered little apple-John."" But whatever his deficiencies in charm, Madison's ... wife Dolley compensated for them with her warmth and gaiety. She was the toast of Washington. Born in 1751, Madison was brought up in Orange County, Virginia, and attended Princeton (then called the College of New Jersey). A student of history and government, well-read in law, he participated in the framing of the Virginia Constitution in 1776, served in the Continental Congress, and was a leader in the Virginia Assembly. When delegates to the Constitutional Convention assembled at Philadelphia, the 36-year-old Madison took frequent and emphatic part in the debates. Madison made a major contribution to the ratification of the Constitution by writing, with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the Federalist essays. In later years, when he was referred to as the ""Father of the Constitution,"" Madison protested that the document was not ""the off-spring of a single brain,"" but ""the work of many heads and many hands."" In Congress, he helped frame the Bill of Rights and enact the first revenue legislation. Out of his leadership in opposition to Hamilton's financial proposals, which he felt would unduly bestow wealth and power upon northern financiers, came the development of the Republican, or Jeffersonian, Party. As President Jefferson's Secretary of State, Madison protested to warring France and Britain that their seizure of American ships was contrary to international law. The protests, John Randolph acidly commented, had the effect of ""a shilling pamphlet hurled against eight hundred ships of war."" Despite the unpopular Embargo Act of 1807, which did not make the belligerent nations change their ways but did cause a depression in the United States, Madison was elected President in 1808. Before he took office the Embargo Act was repealed. During the first year of Madison's Administration, the United States prohibited trade with both Britain and France; then in May, 1810, Congress authorized trade with both, directing the President, if either would accept America's view of neutral rights, to forbid trade with the other nation. Napoleon pretended to comply. Late in 1810, Madison proclaimed non-intercourse with Great Britain. In Congress a young group including Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, the ""War Hawks,"" pressed the President for a more militant policy. The British impressment of American seamen and the seizure of cargoes impelled Madison to give in to the pressure. On June 1, 1812, he asked Congress to declare war. The young Nation was not prepared to fight; its forces took a severe trouncing. The British entered Washington and set fire to the White House and the Capitol. But a few notable naval and military victories, climaxed by Gen. Andrew Jackson's triumph at New Orleans, convinced Americans that the War of 1812 had been gloriously successful. An upsurge of nationalism resulted. The New England Federalists who had opposed the war--and who had even talked secession--were so thoroughly repudiated that Federalism disappeared as a national party. In retirement at Montpelier, his estate in Orange County, Virginia, Madison spoke out against the disruptive states' rights influences that by the 1830's threatened to shatter the Federal Union. In a note opened after his death in 1836, he stated, ""The advice nearest to my heart and deepest in my convictions is that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated.""

Bush. She served as First Lady from 2001 to 2009, advocating for historic education reform and the well-being of women and families worldwide.  During her eight years in the White House, Mrs. Laura Bush was a champion of President Bush's ambitious agenda and a gracious representative of the American people.  A former teacher and librarian, she has dedicated herself to advancing education and promoting the well-being of women and families worldwide.  Mrs. Bush was a key advocate of the President's historic education reform – the No Child Left Behind Act – and a staunch supporter of NCLB's Reading First program, which is the largest early reading initiative in American history.  Early in the President's first term, she launched ""Ready to Read, Ready to Learn,"" an education initiative that promoted best practices in early childhood education and raised awareness of innovative teacher training programs. Inspired by her success with the Texas Book Festival, Mrs. Bush founded the National Book Festival to introduce tens of thousands of Americans to their favorite authors each year. In 2003, Mrs. Bush answered the call to take her education agenda global, as honorary ambassador for the United Nations Literacy Decade. In this role, she has worked with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to promote global literacy programs with measurable outcomes. She convened world leaders for annual summits that inspired successful practices, beginning with the first-ever White House Conference on Global Literacy in 2006. Mrs. Bush has visited schools and met with students in nations from Afghanistan to Zambia, with a particular focus on encouraging girls and women to pursue their education. As the leader of President Bush's Helping America's Youth initiative, Mrs. Bush oversaw 10 Federal agencies in a groundbreaking partnership that realized the vision of the President Bush's Management Agenda. Through a national conference in Washington and six regional conferences, Helping America's Youth taught more than 1,000 community members new strategies to address the needs of at-risk youth.  Since the attacks of September 11, Mrs. Bush has been an outspoken supporter of the women of Afghanistan.  In November 2001, she became the first First Lady to give the President's weekly radio address, speaking out against the Taliban's oppression of women and children.  She has traveled to Afghanistan three times and served as honorary chair of the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council.  Mrs. Bush has been a leading advocate for the cause of human rights in Burma. She drew global attention to the ruling junta's oppression with a 2006 roundtable at the UN headquarters. After Cyclone Nargis devastated Burma in May 2008, Mrs. Bush held an unprecedented press conference in the White House Press Briefing Room and urged the regime to accept international aid. Mrs. Bush also traveled to the Thai-Burma border and met with refugees who fled the abuses of Burma's military regime. Mrs. Bush has traveled to all 50 States and more than 75 countries. She has made five trips to Africa alone in support of President Bush's life-saving global health initiatives, including the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). In visits to 10 of the 15 countries targeted by the PMI and 12 of the 15 PEPFAR countries in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, she witnessed first-hand the success of these historic commitments. In 2006, she joined President Bush to co-host the first-ever White House Summit on Malaria, which helped raise awareness of malaria and support grassroots efforts to eradicate the disease. Mrs. Bush has helped thousands of women take charge of their health by raising awareness of breast cancer and heart disease. As Ambassador for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Heart Truth campaign, Mrs. Bush traveled the country to educate women about the symptoms of heart disease, which is the number one killer of American women. In addition, Mrs. Bush helped launch the U.S.-Middle East Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research and the Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research of the Americas, which unite the resources of researchers and advocates in the United States and around the world. Mrs. Laura Bush was born on November 4, 1946, in Midland, Texas. She earned degrees in education and library science and worked for several years as an elementary school teacher and children's librarian before marrying George Walker Bush. They have twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, and a son-in-law, Henry Hager. The Bush family also includes two dogs, Barney and Miss Beazley. Prior to becoming First Lady of the United States, Mrs. Bush served as the First Lady of Texas.  Learn more about Laura Welch Bush's spouse, George W. Bush.

Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States.  These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic. Tens of thousands of removable aliens have been released into communities across the country, solely because their home countries refuse to accept their repatriation.  Many of these aliens are criminals who have served time in our Federal, State, and local jails.  The presence of such individuals in the United States, and the practices of foreign nations that refuse the repatriation of their nationals, are contrary to the national interest. Although Federal immigration law provides a framework for Federal-State partnerships in enforcing our immigration laws to ensure the removal of aliens who have no right to be in the United States, the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility.  We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.  The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States. Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the executive branch to: (a)  Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and section 3331 of title 5, United States Code; (b)  Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States; (c)  Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law;  (d)  Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed; and (e)  Support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens.  Sec. 3.  Definitions.  The terms of this order, where applicable, shall have the meaning provided by section 1101 of title 8, United States Code. Sec. 4.  Enforcement of the Immigration Laws in the Interior of the United States.  In furtherance of the policy described in section 2 of this order, I hereby direct agencies to employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.  Sec. 5.  Enforcement Priorities.  In executing faithfully the immigration laws of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) shall prioritize for removal those aliens described by the Congress in sections 212(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 235, and 237(a)(2) and (4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 1225, and 1227(a)(2) and (4)), as well as removable aliens who:  (a)  Have been convicted of any criminal offense; (b)  Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved;  (c)  Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; (d)  Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency;  (e)  Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; (f)  Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or (g)  In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.  Sec. 6.  Civil Fines and Penalties.  As soon as practicable, and by no later than one year after the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance and promulgate regulations, where required by law, to ensure the assessment and collection of all fines and penalties that the Secretary is authorized under the law to assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in the United States and from those who facilitate their presence in the United States. Sec. 7.  Additional Enforcement and Removal Officers.  The Secretary, through the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, take all appropriate action to hire 10,000 additional immigration officers, who shall complete relevant training and be authorized to perform the law enforcement functions described in section 287 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357). Sec. 8.  Federal-State Agreements.  It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law. (a)  In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)). (b)  To the extent permitted by law and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary.  Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.   (c)  To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in a manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws for that jurisdiction. Sec. 9.  Sanctuary Jurisdictions.  It is the policy of the executive branch to ensure, to the fullest extent of the law, that a State, or a political subdivision of a State, shall comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373.  (a)  In furtherance of this policy, the Attorney General and the Secretary, in their discretion and to the extent consistent with law, shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 (sanctuary jurisdictions) are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary.  The Secretary has the authority to designate, in his discretion and to the extent consistent with law, a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction.  The Attorney General shall take appropriate enforcement action against any entity that violates 8 U.S.C. 1373, or which has in effect a statute, policy, or practice that prevents or hinders the enforcement of Federal law. (b)  To better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions, the Secretary shall utilize the Declined Detainer Outcome Report or its equivalent and, on a weekly basis, make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens. (c)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is directed to obtain and provide relevant and responsive information on all Federal grant money that currently is received by any sanctuary jurisdiction. Sec. 10.  Review of Previous Immigration Actions and Policies.  (a)  The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to terminate the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) described in the memorandum issued by the Secretary on November 20, 2014, and to reinstitute the immigration program known as ""Secure Communities"" referenced in that memorandum. (b)  The Secretary shall review agency regulations, policies, and procedures for consistency with this order and, if required, publish for notice and comment proposed regulations rescinding or revising any regulations inconsistent with this order and shall consider whether to withdraw or modify any inconsistent policies and procedures, as appropriate and consistent with the law. (c)  To protect our communities and better facilitate the identification, detention, and removal of criminal aliens within constitutional and statutory parameters, the Secretary shall consolidate and revise any applicable forms to more effectively communicate with recipient law enforcement agencies. Sec. 11.  Department of Justice Prosecutions of Immigration Violators.  The Attorney General and the Secretary shall work together to develop and implement a program that ensures that adequate resources are devoted to the prosecution of criminal immigration offenses in the United States, and to develop cooperative strategies to reduce violent crime and the reach of transnational criminal organizations into the United States. Sec. 12.  Recalcitrant Countries.  The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall cooperate to effectively implement the sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), as appropriate.  The Secretary of State shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, ensure that diplomatic efforts and negotiations with foreign states include as a condition precedent the acceptance by those foreign states of their nationals who are subject to removal from the United States. Sec. 13.  Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens.  The Secretary shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to take all appropriate and lawful action to establish within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens and the family members of such victims.  This office shall provide quarterly reports studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States. Sec. 14.  Privacy Act.  Agencies shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law, ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information.   Sec. 15.  Reporting.  Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary and the Attorney General shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order within 90 days of the date of this order and again within 180 days of the date of this order. Sec. 16.  Transparency.   To promote the transparency and situational awareness of criminal aliens in the United States, the Secretary and the Attorney General are hereby directed to collect relevant data and provide quarterly reports on the following: (a)  the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons; (b)  the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated as Federal pretrial detainees under the supervision of the United States Marshals Service; and (c)  the immigration status of all convicted aliens incarcerated in State prisons and local detention centers throughout the United States. Sec. 17.  Personnel Actions.  The Office of Personnel Management shall take appropriate and lawful action to facilitate hiring personnel to implement this order.  Sec. 18.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

EST PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Today I have the honor of welcoming my friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to the White House.  With this visit, the United States again reaffirms our unbreakable bond with our cherished ally, Israel.  The partnership between our two countries built on our shared values has advanced the cause of human freedom, dignity and peace.  These are the building blocks of democracy.   The state of Israel is a symbol to the world of resilience in the face of oppression -- I can think of no other state that's gone through what they've gone -- and of survival in the face of genocide.  We will never forget what the Jewish people have endured.   Your perseverance in the face of hostility, your open democracy in the face of violence, and your success in the face of tall odds is truly inspirational.  The security challenges faced by Israel are enormous, including the threat of Iran's nuclear ambitions, which I've talked a lot about.  One of the worst deals I've ever seen is the Iran deal.  My administration has already imposed new sanctions on Iran, and I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing -- I mean ever -- a nuclear weapon. Our security assistance to Israel is currently at an all-time high, ensuring that Israel has the ability to defend itself from threats of which there are unfortunately many.  Both of our countries will continue and grow.  We have a long history of cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the fight against those who do not value human life.  America and Israel are two nations that cherish the value of all human life. This is one more reason why I reject unfair and one-sided actions against Israel at the United Nations -- just treated Israel, in my opinion, very, very unfairly -- or other international forums, as well as boycotts that target Israel.  Our administration is committed to working with Israel and our common allies in the region towards greater security and stability.  That includes working toward a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.  The United States will encourage a peace and, really, a great peace deal.  We'll be working on it very, very diligently.  Very important to me also -- something we want to do.  But it is the parties themselves who must directly negotiate such an agreement.  We'll be beside them; we'll be working with them. As with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises.  You know that, right?  (Laughter.)   PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Both sides. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I want the Israeli people to know that the United States stands with Israel in the struggle against terrorism.  As you know, Mr. Prime Minister, our two nations will always condemn terrorist acts.  Peace requires nations to uphold the dignity of human life and to be a voice for all of those who are endangered and forgotten.   Those are the ideals to which we all, and will always, aspire and commit.  This will be the first of many productive meetings.  And I, again, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for being with us today.   Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  President Trump, thank you for the truly warm hospitality you and Melania have shown me, my wife Sara, our entire delegation.  I deeply value your friendship.  To me, to the state of Israel, it was so clearly evident in the words you just spoke -- Israel has no better ally than the United States.  And I want to assure you, the United States has no better ally than Israel. Our alliance has been remarkably strong, but under your leadership I’m confident it will get even stronger.  I look forward to working with you to dramatically upgrade our alliance in every field -- in security, in technology, in cyber and trade, and so many others.  And I certainly welcome your forthright call to ensure that Israel is treated fairly in international forums, and that the slander and boycotts of Israel are resisted mightily by the power and moral position of the United States of America. As you have said, our alliance is based on a deep bond of common values and common interests.  And, increasingly, those values and interests are under attack by one malevolent force:  radical Islamic terror.  Mr. President, you’ve shown great clarity and courage in confronting this challenge head-on.  You call for confronting Iran’s terrorist regime, preventing Iran from realizing this terrible deal into a nuclear arsenal.  And you have said that the United States is committed to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons.  You call for the defeat of ISIS.  Under your leadership, I believe we can reverse the rising tide of radical Islam.  And in this great task, as in so many others, Israel stands with you and I stand with you. Mr. President, in rolling back militant Islam, we can seize an historic opportunity -- because, for the first time in my lifetime, and for the first time in the life of my country, Arab countries in the region do not see Israel as an enemy, but, increasingly, as an ally.  And I believe that under your leadership, this change in our region creates an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen security and advance peace. Let us seize this moment together.  Let us bolster security.  Let us seek new avenues of peace.  And let us bring the remarkable alliance between Israel and the United States to even greater heights.   Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  Again, thank you.   We’ll take a couple of questions.  David Brody, Christian Broadcasting.  David. Q    Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister.  Both of you have criticized the Iran nuclear deal, and at times even called for its repeal.  I’m wondering if you’re concerned at all as it relates to not just the National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who is recently no longer here, but also some of those events that have been going on with communication in Russia -- if that is going to hamper this deal at all, and whether or not it would keep Iran from becoming a nuclear state.   And secondly, on the settlement issue, are you both on the same page?  How do you exactly term that as it relates to the settlement issue?  Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Michael Flynn, General Flynn is a wonderful man.  I think he’s been treated very, very unfairly by the media -- as I call it, the fake media, in many cases.  And I think it’s really a sad thing that he was treated so badly.  I think, in addition to that, from intelligence -- papers are being leaked, things are being leaked.  It’s criminal actions, criminal act, and it’s been going on for a long time -- before me.  But now it’s really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.   I think it’s very, very unfair what’s happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated, and the documents and papers that were illegally -- I stress that -- illegally leaked.  Very, very unfair. As far as settlements, I’d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit.  We’ll work something out.  But I would like to see a deal be made.  I think a deal will be made.  I know that every President would like to.  Most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible.  And it wasn’t possible because they didn't do it. But Bibi and I have known each other a long time -- a smart man, great negotiator.  And I think we're going to make a deal.  It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand.  That's a possibility.  So let’s see what we do. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Let’s try it. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Doesn't sound too optimistic, but -- (laughter) -- he’s a good negotiator. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  That's the “art of the deal.”  (Laughter.)   PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I also want to thank -- I also want to thank -- Sara, could you please stand up?  You're so lovely and you've been so nice to Melania.  I appreciate it very much.  (Applause.)  Thank you.   Your turn. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Yes, please.  Go ahead. Q    Thank you very much.  Mr. President, in your vision for the new Middle East peace, are you ready to give up the notion of two-state solution that was adopted by previous administration?  And will you be willing to hear different ideas from the Prime Minister, as some of his partners are asking him to do, for example, annexation of parts of the West Bank and unrestricted settlement constructions?  And one more question:  Are you going to fulfill your promise to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem?  And if so, when? And, Mr. Prime Minister, did you come here tonight to tell the President that you're backing off the two-state solution? Thank you.  PRESIDENT TRUMP:  So I’m looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like.  (Laughter.)  I’m very happy with the one that both parties like.  I can live with either one.   I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two.  But honestly, if Bibi and if the Palestinians -- if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I’m happy with the one they like the best.   As far as the embassy moving to Jerusalem, I’d love to see that happen.  We're looking at it very, very strongly.  We're looking at it with great care -- great care, believe me.  And we’ll see what happens.  Okay? PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Thank you.  I read yesterday that an American official said that if you ask five people what two states would look like, you’d get eight different answers.  Mr. President, if you ask five Israelis, you’d get 12 different answers.  (Laughter.)  But rather than deal with labels, I want to deal with substance.  It’s something I’ve hoped to do for years in a world that's absolutely fixated on labels and not on substance.  So here’s the substance:  There are two prerequisites for peace that I laid out two years -- several years ago, and they haven’t changed. First, the Palestinians must recognize the Jewish state.  They have to stop calling for Israel’s destruction.  They have to stop educating their people for Israel’s destruction. Second, in any peace agreement, Israel must retain the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River.  Because if we don't, we know what will happen -- because otherwise we’ll get another radical Islamic terrorist state in the Palestinian areas exploding the peace, exploding the Middle East. Now, unfortunately, the Palestinians vehemently reject both prerequisites for peace.  First, they continue to call for Israel’s destruction -- inside their schools, inside their mosques, inside the textbooks.  You have to read it to believe it.   They even deny, Mr. President, our historical connection to our homeland.  And I suppose you have to ask yourself:  Why do - - why are Jews called Jews?  Well, the Chinese are called Chinese because they come from China.  The Japanese are called Japanese because they come from Japan.  Well, Jews are called Jews because they come from Judea.  This is our ancestral homeland.  Jews are not foreign colonialists in Judea. So, unfortunately, the Palestinians not only deny the past, they also poison the present.  They name public squares in honor of mass murderers who murdered Israelis, and I have to say also murdered Americans.  They fund -- they pay monthly salaries to the families of murderers, like the family of the terrorist who killed Taylor Force, a wonderful young American, a West Point graduate, who was stabbed to death while visiting Israel. So this is the source of the conflict -- the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish state in any boundary; this persistent rejection.  That's the reason we don't have peace.  Now, that has to change.  I want it to change.  Not only have I not abandoned these two prerequisites of peace; they've become even more important because of the rising tide of fanaticism that has swept the Middle East and has also, unfortunately, infected Palestinian society. So I want this to change.  I want those two prerequisites of peace -- substance, not labels -- I want them reinstated.  But if anyone believes that I, as Prime Minister of Israel, responsible for the security of my country, would blindly walk into a Palestinian terrorist state that seeks the destruction of my country, they're gravely mistaken.   The two prerequisites of peace -- recognition of the Jewish state, and Israel's security needs west of the Jordan -- they remain pertinent.  We have to look for new ways, new ideas on how to reinstate them and how to move peace forward.  And I believe that the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach from involving our newfound Arab partners in the pursuit of a broader peace and peace with the Palestinians.   And I greatly look forward to discussing this in detail with you, Mr. President, because I think that if we work together, we have a shot. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  And we have been discussing that, and it is something that is very different, hasn't been discussed before.  And it's actually a much bigger deal, a much more important deal, in a sense.  It would take in many, many countries and it would cover a very large territory.  So I didn't know you were going to be mentioning that, but that's -- now that you did, I think it's a terrific thing and I think we have some pretty good cooperation from people that in the past would never, ever have even thought about doing this.  So we'll see how that works out. Katie from Townhall.  Where's Katie?  Right there.  Katie. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  You said in your earlier remarks that both sides will have to make compromises when it comes to a peace deal.  You've mentioned a halt on settlements.  Can you lay out a few more specific compromises that you have in mind, both for the Israelis and for the Palestinians?   And, Mr. Prime Minister, what expectations do you have from the new administration about how to either amend the Iran nuclear agreement or how to dismantle it altogether, and how to overall work with the new administration to combat Iran's increased aggression, not only in the last couple of months but the past couple of years as well? PRESIDENT TRUMP:  It's actually an interesting question.  I think that the Israelis are going to have to show some flexibility, which is hard, it's hard to do.  They're going to have to show the fact that they really want to make a deal.  I think our new concept that we've been discussing actually for a while is something that allows them to show more flexibility than they have in the past because you have a lot bigger canvas to play with.  And I think they'll do that.   I think they very much would like to make a deal or I wouldn't be happy and I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be as optimistic as I am.  I really think they -- I can tell you from the standpoint of Bibi and from the standpoint of Israel, I really believe they want to make a deal and they'd like to see the big deal. I think the Palestinians have to get rid of some of that hate that they're taught from a very young age.  They're taught tremendous hate.  I've seen what they're taught.  And you can talk about flexibility there too, but it starts at a very young age and it starts in the school room.  And they have to acknowledge Israel -- they're going to have to do that.  There's no way a deal can be made if they're not ready to acknowledge a very, very great and important country.  And I think they're going to be willing to do that also.  But now I also believe we're going to have, Katie, other players at a very high level, and I think it might make it easier on both the Palestinians and Israel to get something done. Okay?  Thank you.  Very interesting question.  Thank you. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  You asked about Iran.  One thing is preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons -- something that President Trump and I think are deeply committed to do.  And we are obviously going to discuss that.   I think, beyond that, President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the presidency.  He pointed out there are violations, Iranian violations on ballistic missile tests.  By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, ""Israel must be destroyed.""  The Palestinian -- rather the Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said, well, our ballistic missiles are not intended against any country.  No.  They write on the missile in Hebrew, ""Israel must be destroyed.""   So challenging Iran on its violations of ballistic missiles, imposing sanctions on Hezbollah, preventing them, making them pay for the terrorism that they foment throughout the Middle East and beyond, well beyond -- I think that's a change that is clearly evident since President Trump took office.  I welcome that.  I think it's -- let me say this very openly:  I think it's long overdue, and I think that if we work together -- and not just the United States and Israel, but so many others in the region who see eye to eye on the great magnitude and danger of the Iranian threat, then I think we can roll back Iran's aggression and danger.  And that's something that is important for Israel, the Arab states, but I think it's vitally important for America.  These guys are developing ICBMs.  They're developing -- they want to get to a nuclear arsenal, not a bomb, a hundred bombs.  And they want to have the ability to launch them everywhere on Earth, and including, and especially, eventually, the United States.   So this is something that is important for all of us.  I welcome the change, and I intend to work with President Trump very closely so that we can thwart this danger. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Great.  Do you have somebody? PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Moav (ph)? Q    Mr. President, since your election campaign and even after your victory, we’ve seen a sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents across the United States.  And I wonder what you say to those among the Jewish community in the States, and in Israel, and maybe around the world who believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones. And, Mr. Prime Minister, do you agree to what the President just said about the need for Israel to restrain or to stop settlement activity in the West Bank?  And a quick follow-up on my friend’s questions -- simple question:  Do you back off from your vision to the end of the conflict of two-state solution as you laid out in Bar-Ilan speech, or you still support it?  Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had -- 306 Electoral College votes.  We were not supposed to crack 220.  You know that, right?  There was no way to 221, but then they said there’s no way to 270.  And there’s tremendous enthusiasm out there.   I will say that we are going to have peace in this country.  We are going to stop crime in this country.  We are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing that’s going on, because lot of bad things have been taking place over a long period of time.   I think one of the reasons I won the election is we have a very, very divided nation.  Very divided.  And, hopefully, I’ll be able to do something about that.  And, you know, it was something that was very important to me. As far as people -- Jewish people -- so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren.  I think that you’re going to see a lot different United States of America over the next three, four, or eight years.  I think a lot of good things are happening, and you’re going to see a lot of love.  You’re going to see a lot of love.  Okay?  Thank you. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  I believe that the issue of the settlements is not the core of the conflict, nor does it really drive the conflict.  I think it’s an issue, it has to be resolved in the context of peace negotiations.  And I think we also are going to speak about it, President Trump and I, so we can arrive at an understanding so we don’t keep on bumping into each other all the time on this issue.  And we’re going to discuss this. On the question you said, you just came back with your question to the problem that I said.  It’s the label.  What does Abu Mazen mean by two states, okay?  What does he mean?  A state that doesn’t recognize the Jewish state?  A state that basically is open for attack against Israel?  What are we talking about?  Are we talking about Costa Rica, or are we talking about another Iran? So obviously it means different things.  I told you what are the conditions that I believe are necessary for an agreement:  It’s the recognition of the Jewish state and it's Israel’s -- Israel’s -- security control of the entire area.  Otherwise we’re just fantasizing.  Otherwise we’ll get another failed state, another terrorist Islamist dictatorship that will not work for peace but work to destroy us but also destroy any hope -- any hope -- for a peaceful future for our people.   So I’ve been very clear about those conditions, and they haven’t changed.  I haven’t changed.  If you read what I said eight years ago, it’s exactly that.  And I repeated that again, and again, and again.  If you want to deal with labels, deal with labels.  I’ll deal with substance. And finally, if I can respond to something that I know from personal experience.  I’ve known President Trump for many years, and to allude to him, or to his people -- his team, some of whom I’ve known for many years, too.  Can I reveal, Jared, how long we’ve known you?  (Laughter.)  Well, he was never small.  He was always big.  He was always tall.   But I’ve known the President and I’ve known his family and his team for a long time, and there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump.  I think we should put that to rest. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Very nice.  I appreciate that very much. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU:  Thank you. END  12:42 P.M.

Trump Vice President Mike Pence First Lady Melania Trump Mrs. Karen Pence The Cabinet President Donald J. Trump Donald J. Trump is the 45th President of the United States. He believes the United States has incredible potential and will go on to exceed anything that it has achieved in the past. His campaign slogan was Make America Great Again, and that is exactly what he intends to do.  Donald J. Trump is the very definition of the American success story. Throughout his life he has continually set the standards of business and entrepreneurial excellence, especially with his interests in real estate, sports, and entertainment. Likewise, his entry into politics and public service resulted in the Presidential victory in, miraculously, his first ever run for office. After graduating from the Wharton School of Finance, Mr. Trump followed in his father’s footsteps as a real estate developer, and he entered the world of real estate development in New York. The Trump signature soon became synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses in Manhattan and subsequently throughout the world. An accomplished author, Mr. Trump has authored over fourteen bestsellers and his first book, The Art of the Deal, in addition to being the #1 book of the year, is considered a business classic. Mr. Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015, and after seventeen Republican contenders suspended their campaigns, he accepted the Republican nomination for President of the United States in July of 2016. Mr. Trump won the election on November 8 of 2016 in the largest electoral college landslide for a Republican in 28 years. He won over 2,600 counties nationwide, the most since President Reagan in 1984. Additionally, he won over 62 million votes in the popular vote, the highest all-time for a Republican nominee. He also won 306 electoral votes, the most for a Republican since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Millions of Americans rallied behind his message of rebuilding our country and disrupting the status quo—this was a truly national victory and a historic movement. Donald J. Trump campaigned in places he knew Republicans have had difficulty winning—Flint, Michigan, charter schools in inner-city Cleveland, and Hispanic churches in Florida—because he wanted to bring his message of economic empowerment to all Americans. Millions of new Republicans trusted Mr. Trump with their vote because of his focus on delivering prosperity through better trade deals, and as a result there were healthy margins of victory in newly red areas. It is clear that President Trump’s win is one that brought Americans of all backgrounds together, and he is ready to deliver results for the nation on day one and every day of his tenure. President Trump has been married to his wife, Melania, for twelve years and they are parents to their son, Barron.  Additionally, Mr. Trump has four adult children, Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany, and eight grandchildren.  Follow President Trump on Twitter at @POTUS.

She was noted for raising breast cancer awareness and being a passionate supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment. In 25 years of political life, Betty Bloomer Ford did not expect to become First Lady. As wife of Representative Gerald R. Ford, she looked forward to his retirement and more time together. In late 1973 his selection as Vice President was a surprise to her. She was just becoming accustomed to their new roles when he became President upon Mr. Nixon's resignation in August 1974. Born Elizabeth Anne Bloomer in Chicago, she grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and graduated from high school there. She studied modern dance at Bennington College in Vermont, decided to make it a career, and became a member of Martha Graham's noted concert group in New York City, supporting herself as a fashion model for the John Robert Powers firm. Close ties with her family and her home town took her back to Grand Rapids, where she became fashion coordinator for a department store. She also organized her own dance group and taught dance to handicapped children. Her first marriage, at age 24, ended in divorce five years later on the grounds of incompatibility. Not long afterward she began dating Jerry Ford, football hero, graduate of the University of Michigan and Yale Law School, and soon a candidate for Congress. They were married during the 1948 campaign; he won his election; and the Fords lived in the Washington area for nearly three decades thereafter. Their four children--Michael, Jack, Steven, and Susan--were born in the next ten years. As her husband's political career became more demanding, Betty Ford found herself shouldering many of the family responsibilities. She supervised the home, did the cooking, undertook volunteer work, and took part in the activities of ""House wives"" and ""Senate wives"" for Congressional and Republican clubs. In addition, she was an effective campaigner for her husband. Betty Ford faced her new life as First Lady with dignity and serenity. She accepted it as a challenge. ""I like challenges very much,"" she said. She had the self-confidence to express herself with humor and forthrightness whether speaking to friends or to the public. Forced to undergo radical surgery for breast cancer in 1974, she reassured many troubled women by discussing her ordeal openly. She explained that ""maybe if I as First Lady could talk about it candidly and without embarrassment, many other people would be able to as well."" As soon as possible, she resumed her duties as hostess at the Executive Mansion and her role as a public-spirited citizen. She did not hesitate to state her views on controversial issues such as the Equal Rights Amendment, which she strongly supported. From their home in California, she was equally frank about her successful battle against dependency on drugs and alcohol. She helped establish the Betty Ford Center for treatment of this problem at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage. She has described the role of First Lady as ""much more than a 24-hour job than anyone would guess"" and says of her predecessors: ""Now that I realize what they've had to put up with, I have new respect and admiration for every one of them.""

On New Year's Day, 1825, at the last of his annual White House receptions, President James Monroe made a pleasing impression upon a Virginia lady who shook his hand: ""He is tall and well formed. His dress plain and in the old style.... His manner was quiet and dignified. From the frank, honest expression of his eye ... I think he well deserves the encomium passed upon him by the great Jefferson, who said, 'Monroe was so honest that if you turned his soul inside out there would not be a spot on it.' "" Born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, in 1758, Monroe attended the College of William and Mary, fought with distinction in the Continental Army, and practiced law in Fredericksburg, Virginia. As a youthful politician, he joined the anti-Federalists in the Virginia Convention which ratified the Constitution, and in 1790, an advocate of Jeffersonian policies, was elected United States Senator. As Minister to France in 1794-1796, he displayed strong sympathies for the French cause; later, with Robert R. Livingston, he helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase. His ambition and energy, together with the backing of President Madison, made him the Republican choice for the Presidency in 1816. With little Federalist opposition, he easily won re-election in 1820. Monroe made unusually strong Cabinet choices, naming a Southerner, John C. Calhoun, as Secretary of War, and a northerner, John Quincy Adams, as Secretary of State. Only Henry Clay's refusal kept Monroe from adding an outstanding Westerner. Early in his administration, Monroe undertook a goodwill tour. At Boston, his visit was hailed as the beginning of an ""Era of Good Feelings."" Unfortunately these ""good feelings"" did not endure, although Monroe, his popularity undiminished, followed nationalist policies. Across the facade of nationalism, ugly sectional cracks appeared. A painful economic depression undoubtedly increased the dismay of the people of the Missouri Territory in 1819 when their application for admission to the Union as a slave state failed. An amended bill for gradually eliminating slavery in Missouri precipitated two years of bitter debate in Congress. The Missouri Compromise bill resolved the struggle, pairing Missouri as a slave state with Maine, a free state, and barring slavery north and west of Missouri forever. In foreign affairs Monroe proclaimed the fundamental policy that bears his name, responding to the threat that the more conservative governments in Europe might try to aid Spain in winning back her former Latin American colonies. Monroe did not begin formally to recognize the young sister republics until 1822, after ascertaining that Congress would vote appropriations for diplomatic missions. He and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams wished to avoid trouble with Spain until it had ceded the Floridas, as was done in 1821. Great Britain, with its powerful navy, also opposed reconquest of Latin America and suggested that the United States join in proclaiming ""hands off."" Ex-Presidents Jefferson and Madison counseled Monroe to accept the offer, but Secretary Adams advised, ""It would be more candid ... to avow our principles explicitly to Russia and France, than to come in as a cock-boat in the wake of the British man-of-war."" Monroe accepted Adams's advice. Not only must Latin America be left alone, he warned, but also Russia must not encroach southward on the Pacific coast. "". . . the American continents,"" he stated, ""by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European Power."" Some 20 years after Monroe died in 1831, this became known as the Monroe Doctrine.

Kennedy, who served from 1961 to 1963. The inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961 brought to the White House and to the heart of the nation a beautiful young wife and the first young children of a President in half a century. She was born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier, daughter of John Vernon Bouvier III and his wife, Janet Lee. Her early years were divided between New York City and East Hampton, Long Island, where she learned to ride almost as soon as she could walk. She was educated at the best of private schools; she wrote poems and stories, drew illustrations for them, and studied ballet. Her mother, who had obtained a divorce, married Hugh D. Auchincloss in 1942 and brought her two girls to ""Merrywood,"" his home near Washington, D.C., with summers spent at his estate in Newport, Rhode Island. Jacqueline was dubbed ""the Debutante of the Year"" for the 1947-1948 season, but her social success did not keep her from continuing her education. As a Vassar student she traveled extensively, and she spent her junior year in France before graduating from George Washington University. These experiences left her with a great empathy for people of foreign countries, especially the French. In Washington she took a job as ""inquiring photographer"" for a local newspaper. Her path soon crossed that of Senator Kennedy, who had the reputation of being the most eligible bachelor in the capital. Their romance progressed slowly and privately, but their wedding at Newport in 1953 attracted nationwide publicity. With marriage ""Jackie"" had to adapt herself to the new role of wife to one of the country's most energetic political figures. Her own public appearances were highly successful, but limited in number. After the sadness of a miscarriage and the stillbirth of a daughter, Caroline Bouvier was born in 1957; John Jr. was born between the election of 1960 and Inauguration Day. Patrick Bouvier, born prematurely on August 7, 1963, died two days later. To the role of First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy brought beauty, intelligence, and cultivated taste. Her interest in the arts, publicized by press and television, inspired an attention to culture never before evident at a national level. She devoted much time and study to making the White House a museum of American history and decorative arts as well as a family residence of elegance and charm. But she defined her major role as ""to take care of the President"" and added that ""if you bungle raising your children, I don't think whatever else you do well matters very much."" Mrs. Kennedy's gallant courage during the tragedy of her husband's assassination won her the admiration of the world. Thereafter it seemed the public would never allow her the privacy she desired for herself and her children. She moved to New York City; and in 1968 she married the wealthy Greek businessman, Aristotle Onassis, 23 years her senior, who died in March 1975. From 1978 until her death in 1994, Mrs. Onassis worked in New York City as an editor for Doubleday. At her funeral her son described three of her attributes: ""love of words, the bonds of home and family, and her spirit of adventure.""

He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize for work to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development. Jimmy Carter aspired to make Government ""competent and compassionate,"" responsive to the American people and their expectations. His achievements were notable, but in an era of rising energy costs, mounting inflation, and continuing tensions, it was impossible for his administration to meet these high expectations. Carter, who has rarely used his full name--James Earl Carter, Jr.--was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Peanut farming, talk of politics, and devotion to the Baptist faith were mainstays of his upbringing. Upon graduation in 1946 from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Carter married Rosalynn Smith. The Carters have three sons, John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip), Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff), and a daughter, Amy Lynn. After seven years' service as a naval officer, Carter returned to Plains. In 1962 he entered state politics, and eight years later he was elected Governor of Georgia. Among the new young southern governors, he attracted attention by emphasizing ecology, efficiency in government, and the removal of racial barriers. Carter announced his candidacy for President in December 1974 and began a two-year campaign that gradually gained momentum. At the Democratic Convention, he was nominated on the first ballot. He chose Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota as his running mate. Carter campaigned hard against President Gerald R. Ford, debating with him three times. Carter won by 297 electoral votes to 241 for Ford. Carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation and unemployment. By the end of his administration, he could claim an increase of nearly eight million jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit, measured in percentage of the gross national product. Unfortunately, inflation and interest rates were at near record highs, and efforts to reduce them caused a short recession. Carter could point to a number of achievements in domestic affairs. He dealt with the energy shortage by establishing a national energy policy and by decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production. He prompted Government efficiency through civil service reform and proceeded with deregulation of the trucking and airline industries. He sought to improve the environment. His expansion of the national park system included protection of 103 million acres of Alaskan lands. To increase human and social services, he created the Department of Education, bolstered the Social Security system, and appointed record numbers of women, blacks, and Hispanics to Government jobs. In foreign affairs, Carter set his own style. His championing of human rights was coldly received by the Soviet Union and some other nations. In the Middle East, through the Camp David agreement of 1978, he helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel. He succeeded in obtaining ratification of the Panama Canal treaties. Building upon the work of predecessors, he established full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and completed negotiation of the SALT II nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union. There were serious setbacks, however. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused the suspension of plans for ratification of the SALT II pact. The seizure as hostages of the U. S. embassy staff in Iran dominated the news during the last 14 months of the administration. The consequences of Iran's holding Americans captive, together with continuing inflation at home, contributed to Carter's defeat in 1980. Even then, he continued the difficult negotiations over the hostages. Iran finally released the 52 Americans the same day Carter left office.

Brady Press Briefing Room 1:42 P.M. EST MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon.  Just before I came up, I wanted to let you all know that we're monitoring the severe weather that's going through Louisiana at this time.  The President is aware of the situation and is going to be reaching out to local and state officials throughout the day. Also, yesterday evening, the President concurred with the FEMA Administrator's recommendation to approve Governor Bryant's request to add public assistance to the previously issued major disaster declaration in Mississippi.  Per the Governor's request, public assistance will be added for three counties -- Forrest, Lamar, and Perry.  Yesterday, the President had an amazing day at MacDill Air Force Base, where he met with leaders of both Special Operations Command and Central Command, and then had lunch with enlisted servicemembers thanking them for their service and hearing the ideas that were on their mind. The President announced his intent to make historic financial investment in the armed forces of the United States, showing the entire world that America has the back of all those who stand in defense of freedom.  As he has said many times before, the armed forces are at the very center of our fight against radical Islamic terrorism, and we must protect those who protect us. The President kicked off today with a listening session of county sheriffs from around the country.  The President welcomed leaders from the National Sheriffs' Association to the White House and pledged to work closely with all members of the law enforcement community to keep the American people safe.  He assured the sheriffs that the Trump administration will make every effort to stop drugs and crime from flowing into the country, put an end to the opioid epidemic, secure the borders to keep terrorists out, and strengthen the bonds between state, local and federal law enforcement agencies.  The sheriffs thanked the President for what they described as his ""unprecedented"" level of support for law enforcement and offered their full backing of his border security and immigration policies.  They expressed how encouraged they have been by the pro-law enforcement atmosphere that has swept the country in the wake of the President's victory.  They also presented a letter on behalf of the National Sheriffs' Association, thanking the President for his “recent show of support for law enforcement, specifically on immigration and border security issues” and commending the President’s two executive orders for taking “significant steps to enhancing public safety.” The group engaged in a wide-ranging discussion about the issues facing the law enforcement community, which the sheriffs said was an opportunity they hadn't been given under the previous administration.  The sheriffs closed the meeting by thanking the President for defending the rule of law.  And the President took them to the Oval Office to honor them and show his appreciation for their outstanding work they do to keep our communities safe. A list of the attendees is available for those who are interested.   After that meeting, the President held another listening session on how to best fix the VA.  It's a top priority for the President and this administration to ensure that veterans get the care they need when and where they need it.  Tragically, many of our veterans are being failed by a system that does not work.  This administration will reform and modernize the VA under the leadership of Dr. Shulkin, creating a culture of accountability that puts our veterans first. The President welcomed the group to the Roosevelt Room and expressed his intention to take whatever steps are necessary to improve health care access and quality for our heroic veterans. Ms. Tiffany Smiley, the wife of a veteran who was blinded by an IED, detailed her family's difficulty and experience with the VA health care system, and offered suggestions to how it could be improved.  The President, VA Secretary-designate Dr. David Shulkin, and a group of health care experts and veterans advocates, including Ike & Laura Perlmutter, engaged in a wide-ranging discussion on reforming the VA so that the needs of veterans come first.  The experts discussed private sector solutions and innovations that could be used to improve the VA.  The President praised the Secretary-designate for his commitment to veterans and thanked the group for their willingness to serve and do what was best for our veterans.  They plan to meet on a regular basis to discuss their collective efforts to improve the VA and its health care system.  Also this afternoon, the Vice President had a big day on Capitol Hill, where he cast a historic deciding vote for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.  The President believes strongly that our nation’s success depends on the education of our students.  And Betsy DeVos has devoted nearly three decades of her time and talent to promoting educational opportunity.  As Secretary, she will ensure that every student has access to a good school, whether it’s public, private, parochial, charter, or any other kind. The fact that we had to get to the point where the Vice President had to be pulled in to overcome the Democrats’ historic and partisan logjam of the President’s qualified nominee is another glaring reminder of the unprecedented obstruction that Senate Democrats have engaged in throughout this process. The American people sent a strong message when they elected President Trump in November:  They're fed up with business as usual in Washington.  Democrats in the Senate should expect that voters will remember how they stood in the way of the President enacting an agenda that put him into office.  Last week, I noted the President had a fair amount of Cabinet-level appointees awaiting a full vote by the Senate.  We’re looking forward to seeing more of the President’s picks to lead agencies and departments confirmed in the upcoming week, despite these childish tactics of the Democrats in the Senate, who would rather keep the failed status quo than allowing to put the President's people in place. Also on the Hill today, Judge Gorsuch continues a full week of meetings with Republican and Democratic senators.  Yesterday, he met with Senators Tester and Feinstein.  Today he will meet with Senators Sasse, Schumer, Crapo, and Thune.  The President is looking forward to a full hearing for the judge, followed by an up or down vote on this incredibly qualified nominee. At this moment, the President is meeting with Congressman Jason Chaffetz to discuss how to work together to enact his reform agenda.  Later this afternoon, the President will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson.  The President was obviously pleased to welcome and confirm -- swear in Secretary Tillerson in the Oval Office last week, and he's pleased that the Secretary is now able to bring his unique skillset and deep insights to the important work of the State Department. Following his discussion with Secretary Tillerson, the President will have calls with Prime Minister Rajoy of Spain and President Erdogan of Turkey.  We’ll of course have readouts of both of those calls when they're completed. This evening, the President will host young officers from the United States Army Special Forces Qualification Course in the Oval Office.  As the President said yesterday, members of our military and their families are our nation’s heroes.  It is one of his top priorities to ensure that the men and women of our armed forces have the tools, equipment, and resources they need to execute their mission successfully.  The President is looking forward to conveying his gratitude and support to these young brave captains. Later this evening, around 6:00, 9th Circuit Court will hold oral arguments, per its order from yesterday.  I want to quickly run down what we can expect to happen tonight.  A career attorney from the Department of Justice will present an argument in defense of the President’s order.  And to be clear, all that’s at issue tonight is the hearing -- is an interim decision on whether the President’s order is enforced or not until the case is heard on the actual merits of the order.  It’s a simple status quo versus anti-status quo decision. This is just like the case in Boston, which started as a temporary restraining order.  There, once we were able to explain our position, the court lifted the order and held that the President’s executive order could take effect.  As I have stated before, 8 U.S. Code 1182 gives the President constitutional authority for this executive order.  It says, “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions which he may deem to be appropriate.""  We look forward to a final decision on the merits of this soon. Looking ahead, I know a few have been asking for more details on Prime Minister Abe’s visit later this week.  As previously announced, he will visit the White House for meetings on the 10th of February.  The President has also invited him down to Mar-a-Lago, and the two leaders will travel there for the weekend.  This is a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance, and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan. Needless to say, the President is looking very much forward to welcoming the New England Patriots to the White House to celebrate their fifth World Championship.  It was obviously a spectacular game. Lastly, we have our eyes on Kabul today following the tragic suicide bombing that killed at least 19 Afghan civilians and wounded 14 [41].  Just this morning, General Flynn spoke with the Afghan National Security Advisor to reaffirm our continued support for Afghanistan and for our Strategic Partnership.  We condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest possible terms, and we commend the Afghan security forces for their rapid response.  We also reaffirm our support to the Afghan government as they work to defend their people against enemies of peace. And with that, I'll take your questions.  David Jackson. Q    Sean, the list of 78 terrorist attacks that you released, it looked like it had been prepared well in advance.  I mean, was that already on hand when President Trump made his comments?  Or did you do it afterwards and plan to release it? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think the answer was, we had been getting questions as to what the President's remarks were.  We wanted to be very clear that there are a lot of examples between 2014 and 2016 that have occurred, and many of them haven’t gotten the attention that they have deserved.  It’s becoming too often that we’re seeing these attacks not get the spectacular attention that they deserve.  And I think it undermines the understanding of the threat that we face around this country. The reason the President has been acting in so many of the ways that he has with executive order and otherwise, the discussions that he had down at CENTCOM and SOCOM yesterday, are because he cares about making sure that we don’t have attacks in this country, that we’re protected, that we’re ahead of the curve.  And I think what we need to do is to remind people that the Earth is a very dangerous place these days, that ISIS is trying to do us harm, and that the President’s commitment is to keep this country safe. And I think part of this is to make sure that the American people are reminded how prevalent some of these attacks and how much time and attention they have or have not gotten, but, more importantly, to make sure that they understand the unwavering commitment that the President has and the actions that he will take to keep the country safe. Q    Was the list put together after his comments?  MR. SPICER:  Yes.  Yes.   Trey. Q    Thanks, Sean.  On the call with Turkish President Erdogan later today, does President Trump intend to discuss plans for Syrian safe zones?  And does the President expect Turkey to help create those zones? MR. SPICER:  I think we’ll have a readout for you on that.  I don’t want to get ahead of the two leaders’ calls.  Alexis, RealClearPolitics. Q    Sean, I have two questions for you.  You were mentioning that voters are going to remember how senators voted on the President’s Cabinet nominees.  Two Republicans voted against Betsy DeVos -- Senators Collins and Murkowski.  Did the President reach out to either of them?  And will he not forget what Republicans did in that particular nominee situation? MR. SPICER:  I think -- look, the President has been very clear it’s not Republicans that have stood in the way of this nomination of all of these qualified individuals.  It’s been Democrats that have stalled over and over again, not attending hearings, trying to use every delay tactic possible.  It’s those people that have a problem, and I think that’s the message that the party has missed on the Democratic side, which -- and I don’t think that -- I wouldn’t paint it with a broad brush, because I think it’s Senate Democrats, frankly, that haven’t gotten the message. Q    But he never reached out to them? MR. SPICER:  Our team has been in contact with the entire Senate team to make sure that they understand and that they’ve had visits as requested.  But we have been in constant contact with the Senate, members of the Senate, their staffs.  Our legislative affairs team has had an extremely robust schedule of meetings with their teams to make these nominees available to them. But I think the broader issue, again -- and with all due respect, I think it’s interesting that we’re focusing on the votes of two Republicans when you look at the spectrum of antics that have gone on in the Democrats.  I mean, the tactics that they have done over and over and over again to delay, not show up to hearings, filibuster to the extent that they can, run the clock out -- it’s not Republicans that have a problem here, Alexis.  It’s the Democrats that continue to do this. Q    The second question has to do with the President’s remarks about the Affordable Care Act in his interview on Sunday -- because he indicated in his response, in that interview, that he thought that the repeal-and-replace was going to take longer, perhaps into 2018.  Can you clarify whether he is frustrated about this, what he is doing about the timing?  Because, of course, voters who sent him here were anticipating that this might move faster than he was conveying in the interview. MR. SPICER:  Well, I think luckily -- and you saw Speaker Ryan’s comments earlier today -- I think we can have this done legislatively sooner rather than later, but I think the implementation of a lot of the pieces may take a little bit longer. It’s a big, big bill that the Democrats passed.  As you recall, they told us we could read it after they passed it.  We are now going through this to make sure that we do this in a very responsible way, to make sure that health care, which is so vital to so many Americans and their families, is preserved while we put a new system in place that both lowers costs and increases accessibility. But the President, I think, is very encouraged by the commitment and work that’s going on on the Hill to make sure that we get this thing replaced as quick as possible. Fred Lucas. Q    Thanks, Sean.  I wanted to ask -- actually, a follow-up related to that.  Speaker Ryan has actually said -- and I'm quoting -- with Obamacare you can’t “tinker at the margins and repair it.  You can't.  It is a collapsing law.""  Do you agree with that?  And you can’t build on what’s already there, you have to get rid of the entire law? MR. SPICER:  I think what we’re focused on is the end solution.  And I think we’ve been very clear over and over again that the President is going to repeal and replace it, and that what Americans will get at the end of this is a health care solution that, as I’ve said before over and over again, is going to give them a lower-cost health solution with more options.  That’s what they were promised in the first place.  That’s what we can give. And I think the President, being able to approach this in the businesslike manner that he’s done so successfully in the past, is going to ensure that he negotiates prices, that we look at those business-like practices, force competition among states and other things that will help lower cost once and for all, and provide that competition.   Q    On Iran sanctions, does the President have any concerns about the fact that Adam Szubin is the Acting Treasury Secretary in terms of implementing those sanctions? MR. SPICER:  No.  We implemented them -- they went off without a hitch. Fred -- I mean, John Decker. Q    Thanks a lot, Sean.  As you know, the President spoke over the weekend on Twitter and criticized the federal judge appointed by George W. Bush who imposed the nationwide restraining order.  He called him a ""so-called judge.""  Is the President, as it relates to the arguments -- I know you're confident -- but the arguments that will be presented this evening -- is he prepared to accept an adverse ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals? MR. SPICER:  There's no question the President respects the judicial branch and its ruling, but I think that there's no way -- I just read off the U.S. code on that.  I don't think there's any other way that you can interpret that, that the President has the discretion to do what's necessary to keep this country safe.  And I think that's his concern, frankly, right now, is that when the law is such as it is, that anyone could interpret that any other way.  I think he feels confident, just like in the ruling in Boston, that we're going to prevail on this on the merits of the case because it is done so in a very lawful way. Katherine. Q    Will the administration take a position on the Israeli legislation to retract or illegalize the thousands of West Bank settlements?  Last week, obviously, you said building the settlements may not be helpful.  MR. SPICER:  I think that, as I mentioned last week -- and I don't want to get too far ahead of this -- but Prime Minister Netanyahu will be here on the 15th.  I think that will be obviously a topic of discussion right now.  I don't want to get ahead of that. Charlie Spiering. Q    Thanks, Sean.  Just a quick question.  Any response to the calls for impeachment by Representative Maxine Waters? MR. SPICER:  No. Hunter Walker. I mean, I would just say, look, I think, look, it is -- the President is doing everything he can to move this country forward.  And I think whether it's the Democrats in the Senate who are trying to stall these nominees or these little political stunts on the House side, the bottom line is, I think by and large you see the support that the President is receiving for his policies throughout the country.  And it's because I think people recognize, A, that business as usual is over and that the President's commitment to both keeping this country safe, growing the economy and creating jobs is something that is welcomed by all Americans, regardless of party. I think when you see stuff like that, I think it really just shows that they really missed the message that voters sent this past November. Hunter Walker. Q    Thank you, Sean.  CNN reportedly declined to interview Kellyanne Conway on Sunday because of the questions about her credibility.  Is the White House willing to offer alternative representatives to networks that refuse to work with specific spokespeople? MR. SPICER:  Well, frankly, I think that my understanding is they retracted that, they walked that back or denied it, however you want to put it -- I don't care.  But I think Kellyanne is a very trusted aide of the President.  I think for any characterization otherwise is insulting. I don't think -- if they choose not to work with someone, that's up to them.  But I think we're going to continue to put out key leaders of this administration, including Kellyanne, that can articulate the President's policies and agenda. Katie Pavlich. Q    Thanks, Sean, for the question.  Is President Trump planning to ask the Senate to expedite legislation allowing for the swift firing of bad VA employees? MR. SPICER:  I think the President's commitment, as you heard both during the campaign and as he's talked to Dr. Shulkin, is to make sure that we're providing the best care.  And if there's things that are an impediment to that care being offered up or reformed, then he is going to make sure that we enact policies internally that make sure that people who are not doing their job, not servicing veterans, we can figure out how to expedite that process.  But the idea that we're sitting around having a discussion about personnel inhibiting the care that veterans deserve really does not bode well for the reflection that we want on this country.  I mean, people who have served this nation -- we should be bending over backwards to make sure that the benefits and the care and the services that they, frankly, earned is something that is given the highest priority and is something that the President remains highly committed to. Miriam Borgess. Q    Hey, hi.  The President is going to speak later today with the Spanish leader, Mariano Rajoy.  And I would like to know how President Trump sees the relation with Spain, and which are the main issues they are going to discuss in their phone call. MR. SPICER:  So I'm not going to -- we'll have a readout after the call, but I imagine that they're going to talk about a shared commitment to defeating ISIS and that they'll discuss our bilateral relationship and reaffirm our commitment to the two countries.  I think we will have a readout on that call with Spain as we will with all the countries and all the other leaders that we will talk to and we have in the past.  So I don't want to get too far ahead of it, but I would imagine that the current relationship that we have with Spain and our commitment to ISIS will be at the forefront of that. Maria Peña. Q    Yes, here, sorry.  Thank you.  It's kind of loud in here.  So it's a two-part question.  One, can you confirm whether or not the White House has accepted the credentials of the new Mexican ambassador, Gerónimo Gutiérrez?  And also Representative Mike Rogers, I believe, this morning said that he plans to introduce a bill to impose a 2 percent tax on all remittances that Mexicans send to their country to pay for the wall.  Would the President rally behind that bill? MR. SPICER:  So, first, I would have to get back to you on the ambassador’s credentials.  I don't know.  We could check with the Department of State and figure that out.  I don't know that right off the top of my head.   And I’m not going to comment -- I don't -- we don't put out statements of administration policy until the bill has gone through the process. Hallie. Q    Two questions for you.  One, following up on health care, the President, as you know, campaigned for 18 months on replacing the Affordable Care Act.  Where is his plan? MR. SPICER:  He’s working with Congress.  I just answered that question.  But he’s working with Speaker Ryan.  Let me -- you're acting like --  Q    The specifics of it, though.  I mean, does he owe the American people something now given --  MR. SPICER:  And I think he’s been very clear that he owes the American people a result that's going to lower costs and provide more access.  That's what he continues to work with Speaker Ryan on.  I think the Speaker was very clear on it -- that they're having meetings both legislatively and at the principal level to make sure that this gets done. And I think as you heard Speaker Ryan, we continue to be optimistic about getting this thing completed by this year.  It’s a mammoth bill what they passed and did it -- and I think we've got to make sure that we do this right.  We don't want to end up with the same result that Democrats did.  They rushed it through.  No one was able to read the bill.  And premiums have skyrocketed; access and options have gone down.  We need to make sure that we don't do this in a way that's going to end up with the same result. John Roberts. Q    I have a question for you, Sean, though, on Yemen.   MR. SPICER:  Yes. Q    I did say two. Q    One of the world’s most wanted terrorists is now taunting President Trump, calling him a “fool” after that raid. MR. SPICER:  Right.  Q    Any response from the White House?  And do you still stand by your characterization that it was a successful raid? MR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  That -- he was not -- that was -- the raid that was conducted in Yemen was an intelligence-gathering raid.  That's what it was.  It was highly successful.  It achieved the purpose it was going to get -- save the loss of life that we suffered and the injuries that occurred.  The goal -- Q    So you're pushing back on reporting that he was a target? MR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  He was not -- the goal of the raid was intelligence-gathering.  And that's what we received, and that's what we got.  That's why we can deem it a success. John Roberts. Q    If -- and I know that you believe that you have a good case on the merits to lift the temporary restraining order.  If the President does not prevail at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, will he take this to the Supreme Court?   MR. SPICER:  Let’s see where we go.  I think he made it very clear that -- Q    Can I just finish?   MR. SPICER:  Yes, you can.  I’m sorry. Q    And is he concerned that if this does go to the Supreme Court with its current 4-4 makeup, that this temporary restraining order might become a little more permanent?   MR. SPICER:  Well, remember tonight is about just a restraining order.  We're not --  Q    I know what it's about.  That's not the question.  MR. SPICER:  Right, I understand.  But I think that it’s important to explain this to everyone, John, because I know you get it and so many others -- but I just want to make sure.  Tonight is about the restraining order.  It has nothing to do with the merits of the case.  And that's why I think we feel confident.  The question is:  Does the restraining order get lifted or not?  But regardless of what happens tonight, the merits of the case still need to be -- to discuss.   And I think the merits of the case, as they were in Boston, are ones that we feel very confident on because the law is crystal clear on this.  The President has the authority to do this.  It was done so in an interagency process that ensured that all the appropriate people were consulted.  We went through that with flying colors.  I have zero concern that at the end of the day, we’ll be fine.  It’s just a question of going through the process. Q    And I get all that, as you pointed it out.  But if he does not prevail at the 9th Circuit, will he take this case to the Supreme Court?  MR. SPICER:  I’m not going to get -- let’s see where it goes first.  I think our goal right now is to get to a point we can argue it on the merits.  We feel confident, based on how the Court has reacted in Massachusetts, that we're going to be good on the merits. Jonathan Swan. Q    Thanks for the question.  Does President Trump still plan to immediately terminate President Obama’s executive amnesties? MR. SPICER:  With respect to what, DACA and DAPA? Q    DAPA. MR. SPICER:  I’ve said this before, we’ll have further updates on that.  Go ahead. Q    But just in the thing, it said ""immediately terminate.""   MR. SPICER:  I understand that.   Q    So I just wondered what the delay is. MR. SPICER:  And I’ve made it -- and I’ve said before the President will have further updates on both DACA and DAPA very shortly.  We've been very clear on immigration -- what the President’s priorities would be.  As you heard Secretary Kelly testify in front of Congress today, there is going to be continued progress on the wall and on immigration as a whole.  So we're going to have plenty of time to address this.   Right now, he’s trying to do it in a very systematic way in accordance to where we find the biggest problems.  And so he’s been very clear in the past that those who are in this country that pose a threat to us or with a criminal record are where his priorities are going to be first and foremost, and we’re going to move through the rest of folks that are in this country illegally. Sarah. Q    Thank you, Sean.  Back to Iran.  The Ayatollah Khamenei said today that Trump has “helped Iran reveal the true face of America.”  He said Iran doesn’t fear Trump, and he encouraged Iranians to march in the street against America later this week.  Does the President have a response to those very aggressive comments?  And does he plan to take additional action against Iran if its leaders continue to escalate tensions? MR. SPICER:  I think the President -- or the Ayatollah is going to realize that there is a new President in office.  This President is not going to sit by and let Iran flout its violations, or its apparent violations to the joint agreement. But he will continue to take action as he sees fit.  The President has also made clear time and time again that he’s not going to project what those actions will be, and he will not take anything off the table.  But I think Iran is kidding itself if they don’t realize that there is a new President in town. John Gizzi. Q    Thank you, Sean.  On Thursday, weather permitting, the President is going to meet with airline executives from throughout the country.  Two complaints from airline executives, as well as the Pilots Association, have been, one, that Norwegian Airlines got a special advantage, a foreign carrier permit from the Obama administration, and also that the airlines of the Arab Emirates are state-subsidized, and both cases are violations of the Blue Skies Act between the U.S. and the EU.  Is this something he’s going to address?  And is he considering upending President Obama’s foreign carrier permit? MR. SPICER:  Well, again, that will be something that -- that will be decided when they meet, what they’ll talk about.  Obviously, the President is going to want to talk about economic growth and job creation, how he’s enacting orders to make sure the country is safe. On the case of Norwegian, my understanding, if I’m correct, that there is a deal in which they’re having 50 percent of the crews and the pilots are American-based.  They’re flying Boeing planes.  There is a huge economic interest that America has in that deal right now.  I don’t want to get ahead of the President on that.  But just to be clear, I mean, when you’re talking about U.S. jobs, both in terms of the people who are serving those planes and the person who’s building those planes.  That’s a very big difference. Zeke. Q    Thanks, Sean.  A few minutes ago you said that the President wanted to remind the American people of how prevalent terrorist attacks are and that the Earth is a dangerous place.  That kind of breaks with the rhetoric we’ve seen bipartisan administrations use when it comes to terrorist attacks, encouraging the American people to go about their daily lives.   MR. SPICER:  That's not the point that -- no, no, no, --  Q    Does this President have a different message to the American people? MR. SPICER:  I think, yeah, his message to the American people is that he is fully committed to doing everything that he can to keep the country safe.  And I think that there’s a big difference between what you’re saying and the point that he was making yesterday.  And I think that what he’s getting at is making -- he was making a point as to the exposure that attacks get.  And I think that’s what he was getting at, is that we see these things and they’re becoming too prevalent.   And that’s why I think he wants to become ever vigilant to make sure that we don’t ever get lax, that we need to be reminded that places and groups like ISIS continue to seek to do us harm, and that it is his job as Commander-in-Chief to do everything he can to get ahead of the curve and keep this country safe. I think when you look at the poll that came out last week -- and I think it was 67 percent of the American people agree with his proposition to put further restrictions on people, to make sure that we have countries who are sending people to our country that they are coming here for peaceful purposes, and that if we can’t guarantee those countries have the proper vetting and systems in place when they are outbound to the United States, then we need to do what we can, and he will do what he has to as President, to make sure that this country is safe. So I think there is a -- the point that he was making was not to put fear in anybody, but to, rather, reassure them that as President of the United States he is taking every single step to do what he has to to get ahead of the threats, to get ahead of the concerns so we’re not looking in the rearview mirror thinking, what should we have done, what could we have done; that we’re preventing lives -- whether it’s the raid in Yemen, the law that he’s enacting -- that he’s going to do what he can to make sure that this homeland and our people are protected and safe. Mara. Q    Thank you.  I just have two questions.  One on a tweet and one on health care.  When the President tweeted, “If something happens, blame the judge and the court system,” did he mean if a terrorist attack is committed by somebody from these seven countries?  Or any terrorist attack should be blamed on the judge and the court system? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think the point that he -- the tweet is pretty clear.  But I think his point is, is that -- kind of dovetails what I was just saying to Zeke -- he’s doing everything he can.  And he walks into office -- there are seven countries that the Obama administration has already identified as not having the proper systems in place to guarantee our safety -- and I think his immediate reaction is to do what he has to do to make sure that we’re not looking back and saying, you know what we should have done, we should have made sure that we had stricter vetting in place for those seven countries. So he took immediate and decisive action to make sure that this country and our people were protected.  That’s what he’s talking about, is making sure that we don’t have regret, that a month from now or two months from now or a year from now we hadn’t done something to protect people.  And so he acted as quick and decisively as possible to make sure that we put the systems in place to protect our people.  And I don’t think there’s any other way to read that. Q    A question on health care.  Can I just get my second question? MR. SPICER:  Of course. Q    You just said he’ll negotiate prices, and that’s something he -- he ran on negotiating prices for Medicare, drug prices.  And I just want you to clarify where he is on that, because when he met with big pharma the other day, before the meeting he said, we have no choice, we have to get prices down.  After the meeting he said he would oppose anything that makes it harder for these companies to bring their drugs to market, including price fixing by Medicare.  So is he for Medicare negotiating drug prices, or not? MR. SPICER:  He’s for it, yes.  He wants to make sure --   Q    He’s still for it. MR. SPICER:  Absolutely. Q    Okay. MR. SPICER:  The President is clear -- I mean, when you look at the costs of -- not just drug costs.  The U.S. government has not done -- I mean, you look at what -- frankly, the easier way to look at this is what other countries have done -- negotiating costs to keep those down.  As drug prices continue to escalate, that drives up health care costs for every American.  But particularly, there’s a huge burden on America’s seniors who are so much more reliant on drug prices.  And in many cases you have people living on a fix income.  And health care costs -- rising health care costs and prescription drugs continue to be a burden on their ability to live out their lives in a much more enjoyable manner. And so his commitment is to make sure that he does what he can, and I think rather successfully uses his skills as a businessman to drive them down. Margaret. Q    Sean, can you clarify two things?   MR. SPICER:  Sure. Q    One, Secretary Kerry -- Kelly, excuse me, when he was on the Hill today said that the administration right now is not looking at adding other countries to this temporary travel ban list.  Is the White House still giving itself room to add some countries to that list? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think what his point was is, is that right now, he’s not doing it.  You have to look at his testimony in context.  I think he went through the fact that we’re still in this review process, that he is committed to making sure that we look at all other countries.  But as of this moment, there is no immediate desire to add to that, but he is looking at all of the other countries, the procedures that we have with them, the systems we have in place to check them.  And so nothing is final until the end of the review period.   Q    But I had a second question, sorry.  So you said still leaving room to do that.  Something that the President continues to say as a phrase -- and I’m hoping you can define it for us -- is that this is about testing who truly loves America and making sure that those who enter the country are those who truly love America.  How do you quantify that?  What is the President thinking of?  Is that a specific test?  What does that mean? MR. SPICER:  No, I mean -- look, I think there’s a -- I think the President’s goal is to make sure that people aren’t coming here to do us harm; that they're going through the proper extreme vetting in cases where we don't have the information required to make a good judgment on them based on what their country is willing to provide; that we are taking the proper and necessary steps to protect our people. But he doesn't -- if someone is coming here to do us harm or to espouse things that would give us a good indication that they're not coming here for the right reasons, then we need to do everything we can to, A, vet them and, B, unless we're 100 percent certain, keep them out of the country. Q    It's a background check. MR. SPICER:  It's a background check.  But again, I wouldn't just -- it's not.  I mean, it is -- to the extent that we can, it's going to be extreme vetting is what he's talked about; that it's not going to be just letting someone in on a quick check.  If there's any cause for concern, he wants to go to every step possible to make sure that people who are entering this country are doing so because they want to come here for the right reasons and for peaceful reasons. Yeah. Q    Thank you, Sean.  On South Korea, South Korea knows about Trump is very good friend of theirs.  And the (inaudible) most important part of his policy on South Korea?  MR. SPICER:  What will what, please? Q    What was most important part of Trump's policy towards South Korea?  Q    The most important part of the policy --  MR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Look, he had a conversation the other day and we look forward to filling that conversation.  I think obviously the threat of North Korea is the most prominent issue that faces South Korea in our alliance right now.  He wants to reassure the South Korean government, the Blue House, that we are going to do what we can to make sure that we stand with South Korea and that we prevent any further hostile actions from North Korea. So I think that the safety of our country, of South Korea, of the region are going to be clearly the greatest focus of this. Q    John-Christopher, Talk-Media News.  When the President submits his budget, is he committed to pushing Congress to approve sufficient funding for all American students to have either an outstanding public school education or the public funding for them to reach an outstanding private school education? MR. SPICER:  Look, I think the President has talked extensively about education during the primary, whether it's an Associate's Degree, a Bachelor's Degree, a PhD or vo-technical education that we've got to give students these days the options they need for the workforce; that a vo-tech education in some cases is what's in the interest of students in terms of their success, and giving them the skills to work on cars or become a computer engineer or whatever.   But as we head into -- as we look towards the future, we've got to make sure that we're preparing our students to have the skillset that they need.  And it's also the retraining aspect of that -- that as people get older and certain industries start to turn the corner because of technology, that we're allowing people the opportunity for retraining to give them the skillset that they need to reenter the workforce and continue to be productive. So I think as you will see -- look, we literally will swear in the Secretary of Education hopefully later this evening, which we will let you all know -- probably around the 5:00 or 6:00 hour.  But that will be something that he's going to continue to have a conversation with Secretary DeVos about.  Something that she's made clear -- and it's unfortunate that we haven't been able to have this conversation sooner because it was held up for so long -- but I think that's something that Secretary DeVos will be speaking a lot about, about the education funding and skillset and opportunities that we give not just our children but people older in life who are looking to get back into the workforce through another avenue. Q    How about the K-12?  How about the youngsters? MR. SPICER:  I think we'll have plenty of time to discuss the President's budget as we get closer -- as he sort of develops that.  Today, we're excited that Secretary DeVos will get sworn in.   Thanks a lot, guys.  Have a great one.  Take care.

Sec. 2.  Task Force.  (a)  In furtherance of the policy described in section 1 of this order, I hereby direct the Attorney General to establish, and to appoint or designate an individual or individuals to chair, a Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety (Task Force).  The Attorney General shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide administrative support and funding for the Task Force.   (b)  The Attorney General shall determine the characteristics of the Task Force, which shall be composed of individuals appointed or designated by him.

While the country was prosperous when the ""Little Magician"" was elected, less than three months later the financial panic of 1837 punctured the prosperity. Only about 5 feet, 6 inches tall, but trim and erect, Martin Van Buren dressed fastidiously. His impeccable appearance belied his amiability--and his humble background. Of Dutch descent, he was born in 1782, the son of a tavernkeeper and farmer, in Kinderhook, New York. As a young lawyer he became involved in New York politics. As leader of the ""Albany Regency,"" an effective New York political organization, he shrewdly dispensed public offices and bounty in a fashion calculated to bring votes. Yet he faithfully fulfilled official duties, and in 1821 was elected to the United States Senate. By 1827 he had emerged as the principal northern leader for Andrew Jackson. President Jackson rewarded Van Buren by appointing him Secretary of State. As the Cabinet Members appointed at John C. Calhoun's recommendation began to demonstrate only secondary loyalty to Jackson, Van Buren emerged as the President's most trusted adviser. Jackson referred to him as, ""a true man with no guile."" The rift in the Cabinet became serious because of Jackson's differences with Calhoun, a Presidential aspirant. Van Buren suggested a way out of an eventual impasse: he and Secretary of War Eaton resigned, so that Calhoun men would also resign. Jackson appointed a new Cabinet, and sought again to reward Van Buren by appointing him Minister to Great Britain. Vice President Calhoun, as President of the Senate, cast the deciding vote against the appointment--and made a martyr of Van Buren. The ""Little Magician"" was elected Vice President on the Jacksonian ticket in 1832, and won the Presidency in 1836. Van Buren devoted his Inaugural Address to a discourse upon the American experiment as an example to the rest of the world. The country was prosperous, but less than three months later the panic of 1837 punctured the prosperity. Basically, the trouble was the 19th-century cyclical economy of ""boom and bust,"" which was following its regular pattern, but Jackson's financial measures contributed to the crash. His destruction of the Second Bank of the United States had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks; wild speculation in lands, based on easy bank credit, had swept the West. To end this speculation, Jackson in 1836 had issued a Specie Circular requiring that lands be purchased with hard money--gold or silver. In 1837 the panic began. Hundreds of banks and businesses failed. Thousands lost their lands. For about five years the United States was wracked by the worst depression thus far in its history. Programs applied decades later to alleviate economic crisis eluded both Van Buren and his opponents. Van Buren's remedy--continuing Jackson's deflationary policies--only deepened and prolonged the depression. Declaring that the panic was due to recklessness in business and overexpansion of credit, Van Buren devoted himself to maintaining the solvency of the national Government. He opposed not only the creation of a new Bank of the United States but also the placing of Government funds in state banks. He fought for the establishment of an independent treasury system to handle Government transactions. As for Federal aid to internal improvements, he cut off expenditures so completely that the Government even sold the tools it had used on public works. Inclined more and more to oppose the expansion of slavery, Van Buren blocked the annexation of Texas because it assuredly would add to slave territory--and it might bring war with Mexico. Defeated by the Whigs in 1840 for reelection, he was an unsuccessful candidate for President on the Free Soil ticket in 1848. He died in 1862.

(INA), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109 367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104 208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that the Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order as follows: Section 1.  Purpose.  Border security is critically important to the national security of the United States.  Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety.  Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United States.  The recent surge of illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed. Transnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs.  Among those who illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct.  Continued illegal immigration presents a clear and present danger to the interests of the United States. Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the Nation's southern border.  Although Federal immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws    and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders    the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility.  The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation's southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely. Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the executive branch to: (a)  secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism; (b)  detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further proceedings regarding those violations; (c)  expedite determinations of apprehended individuals' claims of eligibility to remain in the United States; (d)  remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed; and (e)  cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities, as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities. Sec. 3.  Definitions.  (a)  ""Asylum officer"" has the meaning given the term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)). (b)  ""Southern border"" shall mean the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico, including all points of entry. (c)  ""Border States"" shall mean the States of the United States immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico. (d)  Except as otherwise noted, ""the Secretary"" shall refer to the Secretary of Homeland Security. (e)  ""Wall"" shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier. (f)  ""Executive department"" shall have the meaning given in section 101 of title 5, United States Code. (g)  ""Regulations"" shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations, and directives lawfully promulgated by agencies. (h)  ""Operational control"" shall mean the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband. Sec. 4.  Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States.  The Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain complete operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the southern border: (a)  In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border; (b)  Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border; (c)  Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and (d)  Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border. Sec. 5.  Detention Facilities.  (a)  The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico. (b)  The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable regulations. (c)  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code. Sec. 6.  Detention for Illegal Entry.  The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the extent permitted by law.  The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as ""catch and release,"" whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law. Sec. 7.  Return to Territory.  The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding. Sec. 8.  Additional Border Patrol Agents.  Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable. Sec. 9.  Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements.  The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid.  Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall submit this information to the Secretary of State.  Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years. Sec. 10.  Federal-State Agreements.  It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law. (a)  In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)). (b)  To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary.  Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties. (c)  To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction. Sec. 11.  Parole, Asylum, and Removal.  It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens. (a)  The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens. (b)  The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by promulgating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted in a manner consistent with the plain language of those provisions. (c)  Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). (d)  The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole. (e)  The Secretary shall take appropriate action to require that all Department of Homeland Security personnel are properly trained on the proper application of section 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) and section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are properly processed, receive appropriate care and placement while in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, and, when appropriate, are safely repatriated in accordance with law. Sec. 12.  Authorization to Enter Federal Lands.  The Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior and any other heads of agencies as necessary, shall take all appropriate action to: (a)  permit all officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to have access to all Federal lands as necessary and appropriate to implement this order; and (b)  enable those officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to perform such actions on Federal lands as the Secretary deems necessary and appropriate to implement this order. Sec. 13.  Priority Enforcement.  The Attorney General shall take all appropriate steps to establish prosecution guidelines and allocate appropriate resources to ensure that Federal prosecutors accord a high priority to prosecutions of offenses having a nexus to the southern border. Sec. 14.  Government Transparency.  The Secretary shall, on a monthly basis and in a publicly available way, report statistical data on aliens apprehended at or near the southern border using a uniform method of reporting by all Department of Homeland Security components, in a format that is easily understandable by the public. Sec. 15.  Reporting.  Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary, within 90 days of the date of this order, and the Attorney General, within 180 days, shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order. Sec. 16.  Hiring.  The Office of Personnel Management shall take appropriate action as may be necessary to facilitate hiring personnel to implement this order. Sec. 17.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Eisenhower Bringing to the Presidency his prestige as commanding general of the victorious forces in Europe during World War II, Dwight D. Eisenhower obtained a truce in Korea and worked incessantly during his two terms (1953-1961) to ease the tensions of the Cold War. Bringing to the Presidency his prestige as commanding general of the victorious forces in Europe during World War II, Dwight D. Eisenhower obtained a truce in Korea and worked incessantly during his two terms to ease the tensions of the Cold War. He pursued the moderate policies of ""Modern Republicanism,"" pointing out as he left office, ""America is today the strongest, most influential, and most productive nation in the world."" Born in Texas in 1890, brought up in Abilene, Kansas, Eisenhower was the third of seven sons. He excelled in sports in high school, and received an appointment to West Point. Stationed in Texas as a second lieutenant, he met Mamie Geneva Doud, whom he married in 1916. In his early Army career, he excelled in staff assignments, serving under Generals John J. Pershing, Douglas MacArthur, and Walter Krueger. After Pearl Harbor, General George C. Marshall called him to Washington for a war plans assignment. He commanded the Allied Forces landing in North Africa in November 1942; on D-Day, 1944, he was Supreme Commander of the troops invading France. After the war, he became President of Columbia University, then took leave to assume supreme command over the new NATO forces being assembled in 1951. Republican emissaries to his headquarters near Paris persuaded him to run for President in 1952. ""I like Ike"" was an irresistible slogan; Eisenhower won a sweeping victory. Negotiating from military strength, he tried to reduce the strains of the Cold War. In 1953, the signing of a truce brought an armed peace along the border of South Korea. The death of Stalin the same year caused shifts in relations with Russia. New Russian leaders consented to a peace treaty neutralizing Austria. Meanwhile, both Russia and the United States had developed hydrogen bombs. With the threat of such destructive force hanging over the world, Eisenhower, with the leaders of the British, French, and Russian governments, met at Geneva in July 1955. The President proposed that the United States and Russia exchange blueprints of each other's military establishments and ""provide within our countries facilities for aerial photography to the other country."" The Russians greeted the proposal with silence, but were so cordial throughout the meetings that tensions relaxed. Suddenly, in September 1955, Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in Denver, Colorado. After seven weeks he left the hospital, and in February 1956 doctors reported his recovery. In November he was elected for his second term. In domestic policy the President pursued a middle course, continuing most of the New Deal and Fair Deal programs, emphasizing a balanced budget. As desegregation of schools began, he sent troops into Little Rock, Arkansas, to assure compliance with the orders of a Federal court; he also ordered the complete desegregation of the Armed Forces. ""There must be no second class citizens in this country,"" he wrote. Eisenhower concentrated on maintaining world peace. He watched with pleasure the development of his ""atoms for peace"" program--the loan of American uranium to ""have not"" nations for peaceful purposes. Before he left office in January 1961, for his farm in Gettysburg, he urged the necessity of maintaining an adequate military strength, but cautioned that vast, long-continued military expenditures could breed potential dangers to our way of life. He concluded with a prayer for peace ""in the goodness of time."" Both themes remained timely and urgent when he died, after a long illness, on March 28, 1969.

W. Bush won the Presidency. She is also the mother of the 43rd President, George W. Bush, and of Florida's 43rd Governor, Jeb Bush. Rarely has a First Lady been greeted by the American people and the press with the approbation and warmth accorded to Barbara Pierce Bush. Perhaps this is prompted by the image she calls ""everybody's grandmother."" People are comfortable with her white hair, her warm, relaxed manner, and her keen wit. With characteristic directness, she says people like her because they know ""I'm fair and I like children and I adore my husband."" Barbara was born in 1925 to Pauline and Marvin Pierce, who later became president of McCall Corporation. In the suburban town of Rye, New York, she had a happy childhood. She went to boarding school at Ashley Hall in South Carolina, and it was at a dance during Christmas vacation when she was only 16 that she met George Bush, a senior at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. They became engaged a year and a half later, just before he went off to war as a Navy torpedo bomber pilot. By the time George returned on leave, Barbara had dropped out of Smith College. Two weeks later, on January 6, 1945, they were married. After the war, George graduated from Yale, and they set out for Texas to start their lives together. Six children were born to them: George, Robin, Jeb, Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy. Meanwhile, George built a business in the oil industry. With Texas as home base, he then turned to politics and public service, serving as a member of Congress, U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of the U. S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and later as Vice President. In those 44 years of marriage, Mrs. Bush managed 29 moves of the family. When her husband was away, she became the family linchpin, providing everything from discipline to carpools. The death of their daughter Robin from leukemia when she was not quite four left George and Barbara Bush with a lifelong compassion. She says, ""Because of Robin, George and I love every living human more."" Barbara Bush was always an asset to her husband during his campaigns for public office. Her friendly, forthright manner won her high marks from the voters and the press. As wife of the Vice President, she selected the promotion of literacy as her special cause. As First Lady, she called working for a more literate America the ""most important issue we have."" Involved with many organizations devoted to this cause, she became Honorary Chairman of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. A strong advocate of volunteerism, Mrs. Bush helped many causes--including the homeless, AIDS, the elderly, and school volunteer programs. Today Barbara Bush lives in a home she and her husband built in Houston, Texas, where she enjoys being part of the community. Their children and grandchildren visit them often in Houston and at the family summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Devoted to her family, Mrs. Bush still finds time to work on an autobiography, serve on the Boards of AmeriCares and the Mayo Clinic, and continue her prominent role in the Barbara Bush Foundation.

EST THE PRESIDENT:  So it's nice to see we have some great retailers here today and we're going to go around the room and we'll all introduce ourselves.  Some of you I've read about on the covers of business magazines and it's great to have you here.  Thank you very much. I'm pleased to host all of you at the White House.  The CEOs -- you're some of the great CEOs of our country and the biggest in the retail industry, which is very important to the country in supporting millions and millions of jobs -- really one of the great job producers.  Probably, would you say, almost number one?  Pretty close, right? MR. KUSHNER:  I agree. THE PRESIDENT:  It is number one. There's a lot of confidence in our economy right now.  There's a great confidence level.  You've been seeing that in the stock market.  You've been seeing that in businesses.  And you've been seeing that at every chart that's taken.  There's evidence also by the jobs report that just came out for January -- 227,000 jobs added.  My administration remains very focused on the issues that will encourage economic growth -- that's what we're all about.  We have a lot of plants moving back into various states, including the state of Ohio, the state of Michigan, Pennsylvania.  You have a lot of companies moving back in, coming back into the country, bringing the jobs with them. We're cutting regulations big league.  We are really cutting them by massive amounts.  The auto industry just left a week ago -- they were here in the same room -- and they are very happy with what we're doing and everyone is.  I think just about every -- the financial industry.  We're having a lot of the different industries in and we're cutting regulations in just about every industry.  In fact, I can't think of any that we're not.  If I do, we have a major story, okay, because I think just every industry we're cutting, some more than others.  You have a very, very big regulatory problem and we're going to take care of that because I want more jobs.  We're doing that because we want more jobs. As you know, the overregulation costs our economy an estimated $2 trillion a year, which is incredible -- $2 trillion -- and it costs your businesses a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money and time.  I've taken executive action to create a permanent structure of regulatory reduction by creating one and one.  So basically, for every one regulation, two are out.  So we knock out two.  So we put in one, but to put in one, you have to knock out two.  That's the least of it, but it's an important symbol. In addition to reducing government regulations, we'll also reform our tax code to help middle-income families and American businesses grow and thrive.  Tax reform is one of the best opportunities to really impact our economy.  So we're doing a massive tax plan.  It's coming along really well.  It will be submitted in the not-too-distant future, and it will be not only good and simpler; it will be -- you're talking about big numbers of savings.  And we're talking also middle income and very much for business.  And the business is for middle income because you can employ a lot of people.  So we hope you're going to do that.   We're going to provide tax relief for families.  We're going to simplify very greatly the tax code -- it's too complicated.  We're going to bring down the number of alternatives, and I think it's going to be just a much, much simpler tax code.  In fact, H&R Block probably won't be too happy -- that's one business that might not be happy with what we're doing.  Other than H&R Block, I think people are going to love it. We're going to lower the rates very, very substantially for virtually everybody in every category, including personal and business.  And I just want to go around the room.  I'd like you to introduce yourself and then I'll tell you a little bit more, and you're going to tell me what you're looking for.  But we want jobs.  We want jobs brought back to the country.  We want them brought back fast.  We want you to expand your stores.  And you'll tell me why you will or why you won't.  And tell me why you won't -- we'll work on you a little bit, right, Vice President Mike Pence?  (Laughter.) So go ahead. MS. SOLTAU:  I'm Jill Soltau.  I'm with JoAnn Fabric and Craft Stores. MR. PECK:  Art Peck with The Gap. THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Very good. MR. JOLY:  Hubert Joly with Best Buy.

She served as First Lady from 1845 to 1849. Silks and satins little Sarah took for granted, growing up on a plantation near Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Elder daughter of Captain Joel and Elizabeth Childress, she gained something rarer from her father's wealth. He sent her and her sister away to school, first to Nashville, then to the Moravians' ""female academy"" at Salem, North Carolina, one of the very few institutions of higher learning available to women in the early 19th century. So she acquired an education that made her especially fitted to assist a man with a political career. James K. Polk was laying the foundation for that career when he met her. He had begun his first year's service in the Tennessee legislature when they were married on New Year's Day, 1824; he was 28, she 20. The story goes that Andrew Jackson had encouraged their romance; he certainly made Polk a political protege, and as such Polk represented a district in Congress for 14 sessions. In an age when motherhood gave a woman her only acknowledged career, Sarah Polk had to resign herself to childlessness. Moreover, no lady would admit to a political role of her own, but Mrs. Polk found scope for her astute mind as well as her social skills. She accompanied her husband to Washington whenever she could, and they soon won a place in its most select social circles. Constantly--but privately--Sarah was helping him with his speeches, copying his correspondence, giving him advice. Much as she enjoyed politics, she would warn him against overwork. He would hand her a newspaper--""Sarah, here is something I wish you to read...""--and she would set to work as well. A devout Presbyterian, she refused to attend horse races or the theater; but she always maintained social contacts of value to James. When he returned to Washington as President in 1845, she stepped to her high position with ease and evident pleasure. She appeared at the inaugural ball, but did not dance. Contrasted with Julia Tyler's waltzes, her entertainments have become famous for sedateness and sobriety. Some later accounts say that the Polks never served wine, but in December 1845 a Congressman's wife recorded in her diary details of a four-hour dinner for forty at the White House--glasses for six different wines, from pink champagne to ruby port and sauterne, ""formed a rainbow around each plate."" Skilled in tactful conversation, Mrs. Polk enjoyed wide popularity as well as deep respect. Only three months after retirement to their fine new home ""Polk Place"" in Nashville, he died, worn out by years of public service. Clad always in black, Sarah Polk lived on in that home for 42 years, guarding the memory of her husband and accepting honors paid to her as honors due to him. The house became a place of pilgrimage. During the Civil War, Mrs. Polk held herself above sectional strife and received with dignity leaders of both Confederate and Union armies; all respected Polk Place as neutral ground. She presided over her house until her death in her 88th year. Buried beside her husband, she was mourned by a nation that had come to regard her as a precious link to the past.

Grant In 1865, as commanding general, Ulysses S. Grant led the Union Armies to victory over the Confederacy in the American Civil War. As an American hero, Grant was later elected the 18th President of the United States (1869–1877), working to implement Congressional Reconstruction and to remove the vestiges of slavery.  Late in the administration of Andrew Johnson, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant quarreled with the President and aligned himself with the Radical Republicans. He was, as the symbol of Union victory during the Civil War, their logical candidate for President in 1868. When he was elected, the American people hoped for an end to turmoil. Grant provided neither vigor nor reform. Looking to Congress for direction, he seemed bewildered. One visitor to the White House noted ""a puzzled pathos, as of a man with a problem before him of which he does not understand the terms."" Born in 1822, Grant was the son of an Ohio tanner. He went to West Point rather against his will and graduated in the middle of his class. In the Mexican War he fought under Gen. Zachary Taylor. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Grant was working in his father's leather store in Galena, Illinois. He was appointed by the Governor to command an unruly volunteer regiment. Grant whipped it into shape and by September 1861 he had risen to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers. He sought to win control of the Mississippi Valley. In February 1862 he took Fort Henry and attacked Fort Donelson. When the Confederate commander asked for terms, Grant replied, ""No terms except an unconditional and immediate surrender can be accepted."" The Confederates surrendered, and President Lincoln promoted Grant to major general of volunteers. At Shiloh in April, Grant fought one of the bloodiest battles in the West and came out less well. President Lincoln fended off demands for his removal by saying, ""I can't spare this man--he fights."" For his next major objective, Grant maneuvered and fought skillfully to win Vicksburg, the key city on the Mississippi, and thus cut the Confederacy in two. Then he broke the Confederate hold on Chattanooga. Lincoln appointed him General-in-Chief in March 1864. Grant directed Sherman to drive through the South while he himself, with the Army of the Potomac, pinned down Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Finally, on April 9, 1865, at Appomattox Court House, Lee surrendered. Grant wrote out magnanimous terms of surrender that would prevent treason trials. As President, Grant presided over the Government much as he had run the Army. Indeed he brought part of his Army staff to the White House. Although a man of scrupulous honesty, Grant as President accepted handsome presents from admirers. Worse, he allowed himself to be seen with two speculators, Jay Gould and James Fisk. When Grant realized their scheme to corner the market in gold, he authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to sell enough gold to wreck their plans, but the speculation had already wrought havoc with business. During his campaign for re-election in 1872, Grant was attacked by Liberal Republican reformers. He called them ""narrow-headed men,"" their eyes so close together that ""they can look out of the same gimlet hole without winking."" The General's friends in the Republican Party came to be known proudly as ""the Old Guard."" Grant allowed Radical Reconstruction to run its course in the South, bolstering it at times with military force. After retiring from the Presidency, Grant became a partner in a financial firm, which went bankrupt. About that time he learned that he had cancer of the throat. He started writing his recollections to pay off his debts and provide for his family, racing against death to produce a memoir that ultimately earned nearly $450,000. Soon after completing the last page, in 1885, he died. The Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from “The Presidents of the United States of America,” by Frank Freidel and Hugh Sidey.

Ford When Gerald R. Ford took the oath of office on August 9, 1974 as our 38th President, he declared, ""I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances...This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.""  When Gerald R. Ford took the oath of office on August 9, 1974, he declared, ""I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances.... This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts."" It was indeed an unprecedented time. He had been the first Vice President chosen under the terms of the Twenty-fifth Amendment and, in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, was succeeding the first President ever to resign. Ford was confronted with almost insuperable tasks. There were the challenges of mastering inflation, reviving a depressed economy, solving chronic energy shortages, and trying to ensure world peace. The President acted to curb the trend toward Government intervention and spending as a means of solving the problems of American society and the economy. In the long run, he believed, this shift would bring a better life for all Americans. Ford's reputation for integrity and openness had made him popular during his 25 years in Congress. From 1965 to 1973, he was House Minority Leader. Born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1913, he grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He starred on the University of Michigan football team, then went to Yale, where he served as assistant coach while earning his law degree. During World War II he attained the rank of lieutenant commander in the Navy. After the war he returned to Grand Rapids, where he began the practice of law, and entered Republican politics. A few weeks before his election to Congress in 1948, he married Elizabeth Bloomer. They have four children: Michael, John, Steven, and Susan. As President, Ford tried to calm earlier controversies by granting former President Nixon a full pardon. His nominee for Vice President, former Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, was the second person to fill that office by appointment. Gradually, Ford selected a cabinet of his own. Ford established his policies during his first year in office, despite opposition from a heavily Democratic Congress. His first goal was to curb inflation. Then, when recession became the Nation's most serious domestic problem, he shifted to measures aimed at stimulating the economy. But, still fearing inflation, Ford vetoed a number of non-military appropriations bills that would have further increased the already heavy budgetary deficit. During his first 14 months as President he vetoed 39 measures. His vetoes were usually sustained. Ford continued as he had in his Congressional days to view himself as ""a moderate in domestic affairs, a conservative in fiscal affairs, and a dyed-in-the-wool internationalist in foreign affairs."" A major goal was to help business operate more freely by reducing taxes upon it and easing the controls exercised by regulatory agencies. ""We...declared our independence 200 years ago, and we are not about to lose it now to paper shufflers and computers,"" he said. In foreign affairs Ford acted vigorously to maintain U. S. power and prestige after the collapse of Cambodia and South Viet Nam. Preventing a new war in the Middle East remained a major objective; by providing aid to both Israel and Egypt, the Ford Administration helped persuade the two countries to accept an interim truce agreement. Detente with the Soviet Union continued. President Ford and Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev set new limitations upon nuclear weapons. President Ford won the Republican nomination for the Presidency in 1976, but lost the election to his Democratic opponent, former Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia. On Inauguration Day, President Carter began his speech: ""For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land."" A grateful people concurred.

Garfield. In the fond eyes of her husband, President James A. Garfield, Lucretia ""grows up to every new emergency with fine tact and faultless taste."" She proved this in the eyes of the nation, though she was always a reserved, self-contained woman. She flatly refused to pose for a campaign photograph, and much preferred a literary circle or informal party to a state reception. Her love of learning she acquired from her father, Zeb Rudolph, a leading citizen of Hiram, Ohio, and devout member of the Disciples of Christ. She first met ""Jim"" Garfield when both attended a nearby school, and they renewed their friendship in 1851 as students at the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute, founded by the Disciples. But ""Crete"" did not attract his special attention until December 1853, when he began a rather cautious courtship, and they did not marry until November 1858, when he was well launched on his career as a teacher. His service in the Union Army from 1861 to 1863 kept them apart; their first child, a daughter, died in 1863. But after his first lonely winter in Washington as a freshman Representative, the family remained together. With a home in the capital as well as one in Ohio they enjoyed a happy domestic life. A two-year-old son died in 1876, but five children grew up healthy and promising; with the passage of time, Lucretia became more and more her husband's companion. In Washington they shared intellectual interests with congenial friends; she went with him to meetings of a locally celebrated literary society. They read together, made social calls together, dined with each other and traveled in company until by 1880 they were as nearly inseparable as his career permitted. Garfield's election to the Presidency brought a cheerful family to the White House in 1881. Though Mrs. Garfield was not particularly interested in a First Lady's social duties, she was deeply conscientious and her genuine hospitality made her dinners and twice-weekly receptions enjoyable. At the age of 49 she was still a slender, graceful little woman with clear dark eyes, her brown hair beginning to show traces of silver. In May she fell gravely ill, apparently from malaria and nervous exhaustion, to her husband's profound distress. ""When you are sick,"" he had written her seven years earlier, ""I am like the inhabitants of countries visited by earthquakes."" She was still a convalescent, at a seaside resort in New Jersey, when he was shot by a demented assassin on July 2. She returned to Washington by special train--""frail, fatigued, desperate,"" reported an eyewitness at the White House, ""but firm and quiet and full of purpose to save."" During the three months her husband fought for his life, her grief, devotion, and fortitude won the respect and sympathy of the country. In September, after his death, the bereaved family went home to their farm in Ohio. For another 36 years she led a strictly private but busy and comfortable life, active in preserving the records of her husband's career. She died on March 14, 1918.

Although an honest and honorable man, Andrew Johnson was one of the most unfortunate of Presidents. Arrayed against him were the Radical Republicans in Congress, brilliantly led and ruthless in their tactics. Johnson was no match for them. Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1808, Johnson grew up in poverty. He was apprenticed to a tailor as a boy, but ran away. He opened a tailor shop in Greeneville, Tennessee, married Eliza McCardle, and participated in debates at the local academy. Entering politics, he became an adept stump speaker, championing the common man and vilifying the plantation aristocracy. As a Member of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the 1840's and '50's, he advocated a homestead bill to provide a free farm for the poor man. During the secession crisis, Johnson remained in the Senate even when Tennessee seceded, which made him a hero in the North and a traitor in the eyes of most Southerners. In 1862 President Lincoln appointed him Military Governor of Tennessee, and Johnson used the state as a laboratory for reconstruction. In 1864 the Republicans, contending that their National Union Party was for all loyal men, nominated Johnson, a Southerner and a Democrat, for Vice President. After Lincoln's death, President Johnson proceeded to reconstruct the former Confederate States while Congress was not in session in 1865. He pardoned all who would take an oath of allegiance, but required leaders and men of wealth to obtain special Presidential pardons. By the time Congress met in December 1865, most southern states were reconstructed, slavery was being abolished, but ""black codes"" to regulate the freedmen were beginning to appear. Radical Republicans in Congress moved vigorously to change Johnson's program. They gained the support of northerners who were dismayed to see Southerners keeping many prewar leaders and imposing many prewar restrictions upon Negroes. The Radicals' first step was to refuse to seat any Senator or Representative from the old Confederacy. Next they passed measures dealing with the former slaves. Johnson vetoed the legislation. The Radicals mustered enough votes in Congress to pass legislation over his veto--the first time that Congress had overridden a President on an important bill. They passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which established Negroes as American citizens and forbade discrimination against them. A few months later Congress submitted to the states the Fourteenth Amendment, which specified that no state should ""deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."" All the former Confederate States except Tennessee refused to ratify the amendment; further, there were two bloody race riots in the South. Speaking in the Middle West, Johnson faced hostile audiences. The Radical Republicans won an overwhelming victory in Congressional elections that fall. In March 1867, the Radicals effected their own plan of Reconstruction, again placing southern states under military rule. They passed laws placing restrictions upon the President. When Johnson allegedly violated one of these, the Tenure of Office Act, by dismissing Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, the House voted eleven articles of impeachment against him. He was tried by the Senate in the spring of 1868 and acquitted by one vote. In 1875, Tennessee returned Johnson to the Senate. He died a few months later.

Harding. Daughter of the richest man in a small town--Amos Kling, a successful businessman--Florence Mabel Kling was born in Marion, Ohio, in 1860, to grow up in a setting of wealth, position, and privilege. Much like her strong-willed father in temperament, she developed a self-reliance rare in girls of that era. A music course at the Cincinnati Conservatory completed her education. When only 19, she eloped with Henry De Wolfe, a neighbor two years her senior. He proved a spendthrift and a heavy drinker who soon deserted her, so she returned to Marion with her baby son. Refusing to live at home, she rented rooms and earned her own money by giving piano lessons to children of the neighborhood. She divorced De Wolfe in 1886 and resumed her maiden name; he died at age 35. Warren G. Harding had come to Marion when only 16 and, showing a flair for newspaper work, had managed to buy the little Daily Star. When he met Florence a courtship quickly developed. Over Amos Kling's angry opposition they were married in 1891, in a house that Harding had planned, and this remained their home for the rest of their lives. (They had no children.) Mrs. Harding soon took over the Star's circulation department, spanking newsboys when necessary. ""No pennies escaped her,"" a friend recalled, and the paper prospered while its owner's political success increased. As he rose through Ohio politics and became a United States Senator, his wife directed all her acumen to his career. He became Republican nominee for President in 1920 and ""the Duchess,"" as he called her, worked tirelessly for his election. In her own words: ""I have only one real hobby--my husband."" She had never been a guest at the White House; and former President Taft, meeting the President-elect and Mrs. Harding, discussed its social customs with her and stressed the value of ceremony. Writing to Nellie, he concluded that the new First Lady was ""a nice woman"" and would ""readily adapt herself."" When Mrs. Harding moved into the White House, she opened mansion and grounds to the public again--both had been closed through President Wilson's illness. She herself suffered from a chronic kidney ailment, but she threw herself into the job of First Lady with energy and willpower. Garden parties for veterans were regular events on a crowded social calendar. The President and his wife relaxed at poker parties in the White House library, where liquor was available although the Eighteenth Amendment made it illegal. Mrs. Harding always liked to travel with her husband. She was with him in the summer of 1923 when he died unexpectedly in California, shortly before the public learned of the major scandals facing his administration. With astonishing fortitude she endured the long train ride to Washington with the President's body, the state funeral at the Capitol, the last service and burial at Marion. She died in Marion on November 21, 1924, surviving Warren Harding by little more than a year of illness and sorrow.

President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton take a tour of the upgrades of the Transwestern Building in Washington, Dec. 2, 2011. (Official White House Photo by Lawrence Jackson) This morning, President Obama met with former President Bill Clinton to announce the next piece of the ""We Can't Wait"" campaign -- a $4 billion effort to improve energy efficiency in buildings across the country. The two were joined by Tom Donohue -- the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- and Randi Weingarten -- the president of the American Federation of Teachers. The group toured a building in northwest Washington that's currently seeing an efficiency upgrade. That improvement employs around 250 full-time workers and will save the building $200,000 a year on its energy bills. Making our buildings more energy efficient is one of the fastest, easiest, and cheapest ways for us to create jobs, save money, and cut down on harmful pollution, President Obama said: It is a trifecta, which is why you’ve got labor and business behind it.  It could save our businesses up to $40 billion a year on their energy bills – money better spent growing and hiring new workers.  It would boost manufacturing of energy-efficient materials.  And when millions of construction workers have found themselves out of work since the housing bubble burst, it will put them back to work doing the work that America needs done.  So this is an idea whose time has come. As part of today’s announcement, President Obama directed all Federal agencies to make at least $2 billion worth of energy efficiency upgrades over the next two months. Additionally, 60 private companies, hospitals, cities, states, colleges, and universities, among others, have collectively committed another $2 billion in energy efficiency retrofits to 1.6 billion square feet of property—roughly the equivalent of 500 Empire State Buildings. The investments announced today are part of President Obama’s Better Buildings Initiative, which set a goal of improving energy efficiency in commercial buildings by 20 percent by 2020. The initiative will reduce energy bills for businesses by $40 billion per year, and one report found it could create up to 114,000 jobs.

Romance glints from the little that is known about Elizabeth Kortright's early life. She was born in New York City in 1768, daughter of an old New York family. Her father, Lawrence, had served the Crown by privateering during the French and Indian War and made a fortune. He took no active part in the War of Independence; and James Monroe wrote to his friend Thomas Jefferson in Paris in 1786 that he had married the daughter of a gentleman, ""injured in his fortunes"" by the Revolution. Strange choice, perhaps, for a patriot veteran with political ambitions and little money of his own; but Elizabeth was beautiful, and love was decisive. They were married in February 1786, when the bride was not yet 18. The young couple planned to live in Fredericksburg, Virginia, where Monroe began his practice of law. His political career, however, kept them on the move as the family increased by two daughters and a son who died in infancy. In 1794, Elizabeth Monroe accompanied her husband to France when President Washington appointed him United States Minister. Arriving in Paris in the midst of the French Revolution, she took a dramatic part in saving Lafayette's wife, imprisoned and expecting death on the guillotine. With only her servants in her carriage, the American Minister's wife went to the prison and asked to see Madame Lafayette. Soon after this hint of American interest, the prisoner was set free. The Monroes became very popular in France, where the diplomat's lady received the affectionate name of la belle Americaine. For 17 years Monroe, his wife at his side, alternated between foreign missions and service as governor or legislator of Virginia. They made the plantation of Oak Hill their home after he inherited it from an uncle, and appeared on the Washington scene in 1811 when he became Madison's Secretary of State. Elizabeth Monroe was an accomplished hostess when her husband took the Presidential oath in 1817. Through much of the administration, however, she was in poor health and curtailed her activities. Wives of the diplomatic corps and other dignitaries took it amiss when she decided to pay no calls--an arduous social duty in a city of widely scattered dwellings and unpaved streets. Moreover, she and her daughter Eliza changed White House customs to create the formal atmosphere of European courts. Even the White House wedding of her daughter Maria was private, in ""the New York style"" rather than the expansive Virginia social style made popular by Dolley Madison. A guest at the Monroes' last levee, on New Year's Day in 1825, described the First Lady as ""regal-looking"" and noted details of interest: ""Her dress was superb black velvet; neck and arms bare and beautifully formed; her hair in puffs and dressed high on the head and ornamented with white ostrich plumes; around her neck an elegant pearl necklace. Though no longer young, she is still a very handsome woman."" In retirement at Oak Hill, Elizabeth Monroe died on September 23, 1830; and family tradition says that her husband burned the letters of their life together.

Trump Proclaims February as American Heart Month AMERICAN HEART MONTH, 2017 - - - - - - - BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION The death rate from heart disease in the United States has fallen dramatically since the 1960s, a significant public health victory.  Despite this progress, heart disease remains a leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, and we must reduce its toll.  During American Heart Month, we remember those who have lost their lives to heart disease and resolve to improve its prevention, detection, and treatment.  It is a time for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to improving cardiovascular health    for ourselves, our families, and our communities. Over the past several decades, we have learned much about factors that contribute to heart disease, how to monitor those triggers, and ways to treat them.  We know that individuals can live longer and better lives by refraining from tobacco use, maintaining an optimal blood pressure and a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.  Innovative companies continue to offer new tools and online systems, giving people more access than ever to information they can use to make informed, health-conscious choices. Scientific research and evidence-based interventions to prevent or treat heart attacks and strokes have played an important part in making these strides.  Developments in technology and the discovery of early markers of heart disease have allowed us to diagnose and treat heart disease sooner than ever before.  American innovators continue to develop treatments for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and our health care providers continue to promote best strategies and educate Americans to stay heart healthy. To highlight the importance of preventing heart disease, Melania and I invite all Americans to wear red this Friday, February 3, 2017, to observe National Wear Red Day.  Working together on National Wear Red Day, and throughout the year, we can raise awareness about heart disease and make our Nation healthier. In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved on December 30, 1963, as amended (36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as American Heart Month. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2017 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 3, 2017.  I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

An exceptionally popular White House hostess, she was voted one of America's 12 greatest living women in 1931. For her ""fine personal influence exerted as First Lady of the Land,"" Grace Coolidge received a gold medal from the National Institute of Social Sciences. In 1931 she was voted one of America's twelve greatest living women. She had grown up in the Green Mountain city of Burlington, Vermont, only child of Andrew and Lemira B. Goodhue, born in 1879. While still a girl she heard of a school for deaf children in Northampton, Massachusetts, and eventually decided to share its challenging work. She graduated from the University of Vermont in 1902 and went to teach at the Clarke School for the Deaf that autumn. In Northampton she met Calvin Coolidge; they belonged to the same boating, picnicking, whist-club set, composed largely of members of the local Congregational Church. In October 1905 they were married at her parents' home. They lived modestly; they moved into half of a duplex two weeks before their first son was born, and she budgeted expenses well within the income of a struggling small-town lawyer. To Grace Coolidge may be credited a full share in her husband's rise in politics. She worked hard, kept up appearances, took her part in town activities, attended her church, and offset his shyness with a gay friendliness. She bore a second son in 1908, and it was she who played backyard baseball with the boys. As Coolidge was rising to the rank of governor, the family kept the duplex; he rented a dollar-and-a-half room in Boston and came home on weekends. In 1921, as wife of the Vice President, Grace Coolidge went from her housewife's routine into Washington society and quickly became the most popular woman in the capital. Her zest for life and her innate simplicity charmed even the most critical. Stylish clothes--a frugal husband's one indulgence--set off her good looks. After Harding's death, she planned the new administration's social life as her husband wanted it: unpretentious but dignified. Her time and her friendliness now belonged to the nation, and she was generous with both. As she wrote later, she was ""I, and yet, not I--this was the wife of the President of the United States and she took precedence over me...."" Under the sorrow of her younger son's sudden death at 16, she never let grief interfere with her duties as First Lady. Tact and gaiety made her one of the most popular hostesses of the White House, and she left Washington in 1929 with the country's respect and love. For greater privacy in Northampton, the Coolidges bought ""The Beeches,"" a large house with spacious grounds. Calvin Coolidge died there in 1933. He had summed up their marriage in his Autobiography: ""For almost a quarter of a century she was borne with my infirmities, and I have rejoiced in her graces."" After his death she sold The Beeches, bought a smaller house, and in time undertook new ventures she had longed to try: her first airplane ride, her first trip to Europe. She kept her aversion to publicity and her sense of fun until her death in 1957. Her chief activity as she grew older was serving as a trustee of the Clarke School; her great pleasure was the family of her surviving son, John.

She died of tuberculosis before he was elected, leaving him one of the few Presidents to remain unmarried in office.  Cousins in a close-knit Dutch community, Hannah Hoes and Martin Van Buren grew up together in Kinderhook, New York. Evidently he wanted to establish his law practice before marrying his sweetheart--they were not wed until 1807, when he was 24 and his bride just three months younger. Apparently their marriage was a happy one, though little is known of Hannah as a person. Van Buren omitted even her name from his autobiography; a gentleman of that day would not shame a lady by public references. A niece who remembered ""her loving, gentle disposition"" emphasized ""her modest, even timid manner."" Church records preserve some details of her life; she seems to have considered formal church affiliation a matter of importance. She bore a son in Kinderhook, three others in Hudson, where Martin served as county surrogate; but the fourth son died in infancy. In 1816 the family moved to the state capital in Albany. Soon the household included Martin's law partner and three apprentices; relatives came and went constantly, and Hannah could return their visits. Contemporary letters indicate that she was busy, sociable, and happy. She gave birth to a fifth boy in January 1817. But the following winter her health was obviously failing, apparently from tuberculosis. Not yet 36, she died on February 5, 1819. The Albany Argus called her ""an ornament of the Christian faith."" Her husband never remarried; he moved into the White House in 1837 as a widower with four bachelor sons. Now accustomed to living in elegant style, he immediately began to refurbish a mansion shabby from public use under Jackson. Across Lafayette Square, Dolley Madison reigned as matriarch of Washington society; when her young relative-by-marriage Angelica Singleton came up from South Carolina for a visit, Dolley took her to the White House to pay a call. Angelica's aristocratic manners, excellent education, and handsome face won the heart of the President's eldest son, Abraham. They were married in November 1838; next spring a honeymoon abroad polished her social experience. Thereafter, while Abraham served as the President's private secretary, Angelica presided as the lady of the White House. The only flaw in her pleasure in this role was the loss of a baby girl. Born at the White House, she lived only a few hours. In later years, though spending much time in South Carolina and in Europe, Angelica and her husband made their home in New York City; she died there in 1878.

Originally intended for the superintendent of the USNO, the house was so lovely that in 1923, the chief of naval operations kicked out the superintendent so he could move in himself. Historically, Vice Presidents and their families lived in their own homes, but the cost of securing these private residences grew substantially over the years. Finally, in 1974, Congress agreed to refurbish the house at the Naval Observatory as a home for the Vice President. Three years passed before any Vice President actually lived at Number One Observatory Circle. Vice President Gerald Ford acceded to the Presidency before he could use the home, and his Vice President, Nelson Rockefeller, only used it for entertaining. Walter Mondale was the first Vice President to move into the home. It has since been home to the families of Vice Presidents Bush, Quayle, Gore, Cheney and Biden. Vice President and Mrs. Pence currently reside there. Vice Presidents have welcomed countless guests to the residence, including foreign leaders and dignitaries. Still, the Naval Observatory has continued to operate. Scientists observe the sun, moon, planets and selected stars, determine and precisely measure the time, and publish astronomical data needed for accurate navigation. The Vice President's Ceremonial Office In addition to the Vice President's Office in the West Wing, the Vice President and his staff maintain a set of offices in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), located next to the West Wing on the White House premises. This office, called the Vice President's Ceremonial Office, served as the Navy Secretary's Office when the EEOB housed the State, Navy and War Departments. Today, the Vice President uses the office for meetings and press interviews. Sixteen Secretaries of the Navy worked here between 1879 and 1921. From 1921 until 1947, General John Pershing occupied the room as Army Chief of Staff and Chairman of the Battle Monuments Commission. Pershing's occupancy of the office was interrupted only once during these 26 years, when President Hoover was forced to relocate his offices following a Christmas Eve fire in the West Wing in 1929. Since 1960, it has been occupied by every Vice President except for Hubert Humphrey, who used a room on the floor below. Since its restoration in the 1980s, it has been considered a ceremonial office. William McPherson, a well-known Boston decorator and painter, designed the room. Its walls and ceiling were decorated with ornamental stenciling and allegorical symbols of the Navy Department, hand painted in typical Victorian colors. The floor is made of mahogany, white maple and cherry, and the two fireplaces are original Belgian black marble. The room’s chandeliers are replicas of the turn-of-the-century gasoliers that formerly adorned the room. These historic fixtures were equipped for both gas and electric power -- with the gas globes on top and the electric lights below. There are several items of note in the room, but the most interesting may be the Vice-President's Desk. This desk is part of the White House collection and was first used by Theodore Roosevelt in 1902. Several Presidents have chosen to use this desk, including Presidents Taft, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, and Eisenhower. It was placed in storage from December of 1929 until 1945, when it was selected by President Truman. Vice President Johnson and each subsequent Vice President has used the desk. The inside of the top drawer has been signed by the various users since the 1940s. A bust of Christopher Columbus — one of the few original items on display — was exhibited in the Secretary’s office between 1898 and 1924. It was removed from the Spanish Cruiser Christabal Colom by the crew of the USS Montgomery after the battle of Santiago in July 1898.   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

Distinguished jurist, effective administrator, but poor politician, William Howard Taft spent four uncomfortable years in the White House. Large, jovial, conscientious, he was caught in the intense battles between Progressives and conservatives, and got scant credit for the achievements of his administration. Born in 1857, the son of a distinguished judge, he graduated from Yale, and returned to Cincinnati to study and practice law. He rose in politics through Republican judiciary appointments, through his own competence and availability, and because, as he once wrote facetiously, he always had his ""plate the right side up when offices were falling."" But Taft much preferred law to politics. He was appointed a Federal circuit judge at 34. He aspired to be a member of the Supreme Court, but his wife, Helen Herron Taft, held other ambitions for him. His route to the White House was via administrative posts. President McKinley sent him to the Philippines in 1900 as chief civil administrator. Sympathetic toward the Filipinos, he improved the economy, built roads and schools, and gave the people at least some participation in government. President Roosevelt made him Secretary of War, and by 1907 had decided that Taft should be his successor. The Republican Convention nominated him the next year. Taft disliked the campaign--""one of the most uncomfortable four months of my life."" But he pledged his loyalty to the Roosevelt program, popular in the West, while his brother Charles reassured eastern Republicans. William Jennings Bryan, running on the Democratic ticket for a third time, complained that he was having to oppose two candidates, a western progressive Taft and an eastern conservative Taft. Progressives were pleased with Taft's election. ""Roosevelt has cut enough hay,"" they said; ""Taft is the man to put it into the barn."" Conservatives were delighted to be rid of Roosevelt--the ""mad messiah."" Taft recognized that his techniques would differ from those of his predecessor. Unlike Roosevelt, Taft did not believe in the stretching of Presidential powers. He once commented that Roosevelt ""ought more often to have admitted the legal way of reaching the same ends."" Taft alienated many liberal Republicans who later formed the Progressive Party, by defending the Payne-Aldrich Act which unexpectedly continued high tariff rates. A trade agreement with Canada, which Taft pushed through Congress, would have pleased eastern advocates of a low tariff, but the Canadians rejected it. He further antagonized Progressives by upholding his Secretary of the Interior, accused of failing to carry out Roosevelt's conservation policies. In the angry Progressive onslaught against him, little attention was paid to the fact that his administration initiated 80 antitrust suits and that Congress submitted to the states amendments for a Federal income tax and the direct election of Senators. A postal savings system was established, and the Interstate Commerce Commission was directed to set railroad rates. In 1912, when the Republicans renominated Taft, Roosevelt bolted the party to lead the Progressives, thus guaranteeing the election of Woodrow Wilson. Taft, free of the Presidency, served as Professor of Law at Yale until President Harding made him Chief Justice of the United States, a position he held until just before his death in 1930. To Taft, the appointment was his greatest honor; he wrote: ""I don't remember that I ever was President.""

Nixon Richard Nixon was elected the 37th President of the United States (1969-1974) after previously serving as a U.S. Representative and a U.S. Senator from California. After successfully ending American fighting in Vietnam and improving international relations with the U.S.S.R. and China, he became the only President to ever resign the office, as a result of the Watergate scandal. Reconciliation was the first goal set by President Richard M. Nixon. The Nation was painfully divided, with turbulence in the cities and war overseas. During his Presidency, Nixon succeeded in ending American fighting in Viet Nam and improving relations with the U.S.S.R. and China. But the Watergate scandal brought fresh divisions to the country and ultimately led to his resignation. His election in 1968 had climaxed a career unusual on two counts: his early success and his comeback after being defeated for President in 1960 and for Governor of California in 1962. Born in California in 1913, Nixon had a brilliant record at Whittier College and Duke University Law School before beginning the practice of law. In 1940, he married Patricia Ryan; they had two daughters, Patricia (Tricia) and Julie. During World War II, Nixon served as a Navy lieutenant commander in the Pacific. On leaving the service, he was elected to Congress from his California district. In 1950, he won a Senate seat. Two years later, General Eisenhower selected Nixon, age 39, to be his running mate. As Vice President, Nixon took on major duties in the Eisenhower Administration. Nominated for President by acclamation in 1960, he lost by a narrow margin to John F. Kennedy. In 1968, he again won his party's nomination, and went on to defeat Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and third-party candidate George C. Wallace. His accomplishments while in office included revenue sharing, the end of the draft, new anticrime laws, and a broad environmental program. As he had promised, he appointed Justices of conservative philosophy to the Supreme Court. One of the most dramatic events of his first term occurred in 1969, when American astronauts made the first moon landing. Some of his most acclaimed achievements came in his quest for world stability. During visits in 1972 to Beijing and Moscow, he reduced tensions with China and the U.S.S.R. His summit meetings with Russian leader Leonid I. Brezhnev produced a treaty to limit strategic nuclear weapons. In January 1973, he announced an accord with North Viet Nam to end American involvement in Indochina. In 1974, his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, negotiated disengagement agreements between Israel and its opponents, Egypt and Syria. In his 1972 bid for office, Nixon defeated Democratic candidate George McGovern by one of the widest margins on record. Within a few months, his administration was embattled over the so-called ""Watergate"" scandal, stemming from a break-in at the offices of the Democratic National Committee during the 1972 campaign. The break-in was traced to officials of the Committee to Re-elect the President. A number of administration officials resigned; some were later convicted of offenses connected with efforts to cover up the affair. Nixon denied any personal involvement, but the courts forced him to yield tape recordings which indicated that he had, in fact, tried to divert the investigation. As a result of unrelated scandals in Maryland, Vice President Spiro T. Agnew resigned in 1973. Nixon nominated, and Congress approved, House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford as Vice President. Faced with what seemed almost certain impeachment, Nixon announced on August 8, 1974, that he would resign the next day to begin ""that process of healing which is so desperately needed in America."" In his last years, Nixon gained praise as an elder statesman. By the time of his death on April 22, 1994, he had written numerous books on his experiences in public life and on foreign policy.

EST SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Hi.  Today’s briefing will be on background.  You may quote the official as a senior administration official.  With that, I will turn it over to our senior administration official. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Great.  Thanks, and hi, everyone.  So just before we get started with Q and A, I’ll just say a couple words.  I think that in the first few weeks of the Trump administration, you can see the importance that President Trump has placed on our alliances in the Asia Pacific.  Alliances, in his view, are central to our security and prosperity.  At the end of the day, America is great because of our alliances, and the U.S. recognizes that we have tremendous interests across the region.  The President has already spoken to several of his counterparts across the region, including Japan and Korea, Australia and New Zealand.   I joined Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis on his first trip as Secretary of Defense to Korea, as well as to Japan last week, and Secretary Mattis’ words and deeds, I think, really went a long way toward reassuring our allies that we stand with them, shoulder to shoulder, 100 percent, and that we’re seeking to strengthen what are already longstanding and major and important alliances.   So it’s really in that light that Prime Minister Abe is visiting, arriving tonight in Washington for a visit that’s going to stretch into the weekend.  He is only the second head of state to visit President Trump since his inauguration. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Minor clarification.  Minor clarification.  Wouldn’t he be more properly described as a head of government? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thank you -- because of the emperor.  So, and he is also -- or is it because of the Queen actually, in the UK? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, right, exactly.  And Theresa May is head of government and -- right. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I hear you.  So it’s not the first time that he’s met Prime Minister Abe.  Prime Minister Abe was the first leader to (inaudible) President Trump after the election.  They’ve had already a number of conversations, and I think that that really makes clear the importance that the President is placing on that relationship and on the U.S. role in the Asia Pacific region. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  All right, are you ready for questions? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay.  Let’s open it up. Q    Hello?  Hey, sorry, the operator was talking, I couldn’t hear.  It’s Margaret Talev with Bloomberg.  Thanks for doing the call. First of all, just hoping you can walk us through his schedule.  What time is the news conference?  What’s happening tomorrow versus Saturday, yadda yadda?  I also am wondering if you can address -- do you expect any deliverables and/or any reportable developments on nuclear power, on high-speed rail, or on anything bilateral trade-ish, TPP-ish? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Right, okay.  So I think you’re going to get the precise schedule through my colleague's office.  So I'm not going to go into extreme detail just out of fear of giving you bad -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  To clarify that, you'll get it through main press.   SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  But just some of the highlights -- the Prime Minister and his delegation are going to meet with President Trump in the Oval Office tomorrow.  They are going to have a conversation that's going to cover a very wide range of subjects dealing with the bilateral relationship, the security piece of the relationship, as well as the economic, and also talking about matters of mutual interest regionally and globally as well. After that, there is going to be a working lunch.  It will be a slightly larger grouping of people.  And that lunch will probably delve more deeply into the economic piece of the relationship.  And from there, the President and the Prime Minister are going to travel down to Palm Beach, where the Prime Minister and his wife will be guests of President Trump for the weekend.  And I imagine that there will be a fair bit of golf involved, as well as more time together eating and just relaxing really down at Mar-a-Lago.   Q    News conference? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The second part in terms of deliverables -- I'll leave it to the Japanese to talk in more concrete terms about what might be announced in the way of concrete deliverables on the economic side.  But I can tell you that the U.S. and Japan represent together 30 percent of the world's GDP.  We share an interest in sustaining a strong global economy, ensuring financial stability, and ensuring job growth in both countries.  And Prime Minister Abe is well acquainted with President Trump's priorities, which you could sum up in three words -- jobs, jobs, jobs -- when it comes to the economic relationship.   And so I think that they'll have pretty in-depth discussions about the overall relationship as well as reaffirming the interest in seeing a free and rules-based trading order in the region.  But I'll leave it to you and your colleagues in the press to extract from the Japanese any concrete deliverables that might come. Q    My question is about whether the Senkaku Islands will be on the agenda and whether President Trump, given his track record of being willing to break from previous U.S. policy, would be considering taking a different position on the sovereignty of the Senkakus, particularly in light of his effort to create leverage in negotiations with China. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Got it.  Brian, good to hear your voice.  So on the Senkakus, the standing U.S. policy has been that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Article 5 of that treaty does apply to the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which we recognize as being administered by Japan.  That certainly is the Trump administration’s policy, as well.  And I can -- I would expect certainly for you to hear on that subject and in fairly concrete terms that President Trump is committed to that treaty and it extending.  We oppose any unilateral actions that would seek to undermine Japan’s administration of the islands.   As for the question of sovereignty, that is really something that I would not expect to see addressed in this visit. Q    Thanks for doing the call.  I wanted to get a question on color that shapes how Prime Minister Abe became the recipient of this sort of informal summit, the first of this President, how that came about, and whether or not that means that the President will have more sort of unfettered time to talk about issues in a sort of different context than he would in the White House.  And then I didn't hear you address whether there would be a news conference -- to Margaret’s question.   And just lastly on the question of trade, kind of dovetailing with what Brian was asking with respect to China, are there things on the agenda that would allow the Trump administration to move forward with the Japanese on any sort of bilateral trade agreement that would supplant TPP? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Got it.  Okay, so in terms of color about how this summit came about, I think that it was a natural result of the foundation that was laid before the inauguration with Prime Minister Abe’s early visit.  And it was the natural result of the President’s belief that our alliances are central to our success, both in terms of security and prosperity in the region.   As to whether there will be other meetings that follow a sort of -- a casual format, or what you call “unfettered” time together, I wouldn’t be surprised if that was the case.  The President does have a -- believes in getting to know leaders that he knows he’s going to be spending a lot of time dealing with.  And on relationships that are important to him, he believes he can get the measure of the people through more informal settings.  And so I imagine that he’ll make use of time outside of Washington, D.C., with leaders from time to time. As for a news conference, my colleague can confirm, but, yes, there will be a press conference tomorrow after the -- I believe it’s after the meeting in the Oval Office.  And on trade discussions, the President I think has made pretty clear that he believes that bilateral agreements are really the way to go for the United States, that in a bilateral agreement you can negotiate terms that are more favorable to the United States than you can negotiate in a multilateral agreement, where sometimes you’re held to the standard of the weakest link in the compact. So I’m not going to get ahead of discussions tomorrow to see where discussions go.  But I think that this is a first -- it’s really a first summit since they’ve come into office, so they’re going to be talking on a pretty wide range of subjects and certainly touching on possible paths forward with relation to the overall economic relationship.  But we’ll leave it at that. Q    Thank you so much for the call, guys.  And thank you for giving me an opportunity to ask a question.  What I wanted to ask you is, there is a certain attempt to forge closer ties between Japan and Russia.  There has been recently a meeting between President Putin and Prime Minister Abe.  And we see a general -- I don’t know if I want to use the word rapprochement between the two countries -- well, certainly something like that is taking place.  I wanted to ask you -- does the Trump administration have any objections to that?  Or do you encourage that?  How do you view those bilateral attempts between Russia and Japan?  Thank you. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Thanks very much.  We certainly understand that Japan, as a neighbor of Russia, puts high importance on its own bilateral relations with Russia.  And the United States respects that and isn’t seeking to interfere with Prime Minister Abe’s priorities in his dealings with Russia.  But I’ll leave it to Prime Minister Abe and his government to talk in detail about that bilateral relationship. Q    I wanted to ask if you had any specific item that the President is expected to push Prime Minister Abe on.  For example, currency manipulation does seem to be a subject of those around him that has been stressed throughout TPP negotiations from the Republican side.  Thank you. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yeah, I mean, the President’s comments the other day about currency manipulation weren’t the first comments he’s made about his views on that subject.  I think that over the course of a long weekend together, the two leaders are going to cover a pretty broad range of subjects.  I don’t think that’s necessarily a -- I can tell you that’s not something that’s at the top of the list, but whether it comes up naturally in conversation, we’ll see over the course of that meeting. Q    Hi, this is Kyle Cardine from Fuji TV.  First, I wanted to ask, yesterday Sean Spicer said he would take the question in regards to who was paying for Prime Minister Abe’s visit to Mar-a-Lago.  And also we have one more from our bureau chief.   Q    Hi, the President the other day said that Japan is sending hundreds of thousands of cars with big ships, but U.S. cannot sell its cars in Japan.  But, in fact, there's no importing tax in Japan, and also the Japanese car manufacturing companies are creating a lot of jobs here in the United States.  How do you respond to this kind of Japanese government opinion? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'm sorry, the line went a little fuzzy just at the end of your bureau chief's question.  I'm sorry, if you could repeat that. Q    My question is, the President said the U.S. cannot sell its own cars in Japan, but, in fact, there's no importing tax in Japan for U.S. cars.  And also, the Japanese car manufacturing companies are creating a lot of jobs here in the United States because they are producing most of the cars in the U.S.  How do you respond to this kind of Japanese government opinion?  Thank you. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Right.  Okay, so on who's paying for the visit, I'd defer to Sean Spicer to get back to you on that, since I'm not directly involved with the logistics.  I'm sure that whatever arrangement was made -- SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I can address that.  The visit to Mar-a-Lago is a personal gift of -- I don’t know exactly how we're phrasing it, but it's something that the President is doing for the Prime Minister. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Got it.  And on your second one, I would really -- what I'd like to do is defer to my colleague who's actually working on the economic piece in more detail than I am on this visit.  And he's not on the line, so my excuse to dodge the question -- the import tax.  But automobiles is certainly going to be an important topic of conversation in both directions, because it's such an iconic and critical part of the Japanese economy.  It's of high interest to President Trump.  And I'm sure that that will come up in discussion. Q    Hey, it's Olivier Knox at Yahoo! News.  I have a couple for you.  The first one is, unless I missed it, the President has not yet spoken to Xi Jinping.  Is there, beyond the sort of symbolic importance of this, are you sending a deliberate message by doing that?  And then, specifically for you, what's the President's position in terms of North Korea in terms of a six-party-like approach or unilateral pressure? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  So in terms of -- you're right that the President Trump has not spoken with President Xi Jinping.  The two have exchanged letters.  Xi Jinping had sent a congratulatory letter on the day of the President's inauguration.  And President Trump yesterday sent a letter to Xi Jinping really to wish President Xi and the people of China a happy Lantern Festival -- the Lantern Festival is on Saturday.  I recommend you going and getting those soup dumplings somewhere in the D.C. area -- (laughter) -- which is fun to do.  And, of course, a prosperous and healthy year of the rooster, as well.   The President, in his note to Xi Jinping, stated that he believes that having a constructive relationship with China would be something that would serve the fundamental interests of both of our countries and really the region in the world more widely, and that he does look forward to discussing matters of mutual cooperation, as well as delving into some of the well-known differences in the relationship.  So they are in contact. To your second question about six-party talks and the like, I'd say that it's right now premature to detail a North Korea strategy on the part of the Trump administration.  And in time we'll have more that we'll be prepared to say about that.  Japan and the United States both strongly urge North Korea not to take provocative acts.  And, of course, were they to do so, that would be information that would feed into and inform a Trump administration approach to the DPRK. Q    The Japanese I’ve spoken with since the campaign have obviously been quite nervous about some of the rhetoric that they heard from the President back on the campaign trail about paying more for the bases and wouldn’t mind perhaps if Japan and South Korea built their own nuclear weapons.  What is -- how is the President going to assure Prime Minister Abe that the United States truly has its back and that there’s no need for the Japanese to worry that the United States isn’t going to be there for its defense? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Sure.  I think the way he’ll do it is both in words and in actions, and those words and actions are already taking place.   Secretary of Defense Mattis, who the President had asked to visit the region, made very clear statements about the strength of the alliance, that these alliances and our commitment to them are unwavering and really the cornerstone of prosperity, security and freedom in the Asia Pacific region. So I think that you’re going to hear similar messages from the President himself.  And I think that that will go a long way towards dispelling any doubts that may still remain, or Japanese and Korean and friends and other friends and allies throughout the region. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Okay.  Thank you for doing that.  Thanks, everybody, for joining.  We appreciate it.   END 12:30 P.M.

Policy. The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) under development by Dakota Access, LLC, represents a substantial, multi-billion-dollar private investment in our Nation's energy infrastructure. This approximately 1,100-mile pipeline is designed to carry approximately 500,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to oil markets in the United States. At this time, the DAPL is more than 90 percent complete across its entire route. Only a limited portion remains to be constructed. I believe that construction and operation of lawfully permitted pipeline infrastructure serve the national interest. Accordingly, pursuant to the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct as follows: Sec. 2. Directives. (a) Pipeline Approval Review. The Secretary of the Army shall instruct the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), including the Commanding General and Chief of Engineers, to take all actions necessary and appropriate to: (i) review and approve in an expedited manner, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, and with such conditions as are necessary or appropriate, requests for approvals to construct and operate the DAPL, including easements or rights-of-way to cross Federal areas under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended, 30 U.S.C. 185; permits or approvals under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344; permits or approvals under section 14 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, 33 U.S.C. 408; and such other Federal approvals as may be necessary; (ii) consider, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, whether to rescind or modify the memorandum by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works dated December 4, 2016 (Proposed Dakota Access Pipeline Crossing at Lake Oahe, North Dakota), and whether to withdraw the Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement in Connection with Dakota Access, LLC's Request for an Easement to Cross Lake Oahe, North Dakota, dated January 18, 2017, and published at 82 Fed. Reg. 5543; (iii) consider, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, prior reviews and determinations, including the Environmental Assessment issued in July of 2016 for the DAPL, as satisfying all applicable requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., and any other provision of law that requires executive agency consultation or review (including the consultation or review required under section 7(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1536(a)); (iv) review and grant, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, requests for waivers of notice periods arising from or related to USACE real estate policies and regulations; and (v) issue, to the extent permitted by law and as warranted, any approved easements or rights-of-way immediately after notice is provided to the Congress pursuant to section 28(w) of the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended, 30 U.S.C. 185(w). (b) Publication. The Secretary of the Army shall promptly provide a copy of this memorandum to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the Senate, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and the Governors of each State located along the Dakota Access Pipeline route. The Secretary of the Army is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register. (c) Private Property.

Land or an interest in land for the pipeline and facilities described herein may only be acquired consistently with the Constitution and applicable State laws. Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.   DONALD J.

EST THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Dennis.  And I have to say, I love South Carolina.  I love it.  (Applause.)   Remember we came down -- all together, we came down, and this was going to be a place that was tough to win, and we won in a landslide.  This was a good one.  (Applause.)  So I want to thank the people of South Carolina and your governor -- tremendous guy.  He supported us right from the beginning.  So I'd like to thank Governor McMaster for the incredible job.  He's right here someplace.  Thank you very much.  You have been fantastic. And I have to say also, that is one beautiful airplane.  (Applause.)  Congratulations to the men and women here who have built it.  What an amazing piece of art.  What an amazing piece of work.   Thank you, Dennis, for the invitation to be with you today.  You know, in the old days, when I made this speech I got paid a lot of money.  Now I have to do it for nothing.  (Laughter and applause.)  Not a good deal, but that's okay.  We love it. It’s wonderful to be back in South Carolina, especially with your new governor.  Where is Henry?  He's around here someplace.  Where is he?  Stand up, Henry.  Proud of you.  He helped us so much.  (Applause.)  And I want to also thank your former governor, Nikki Haley, who is doing an awfully good job for us.  (Applause.)  She's representing America very well as our ambassador to the United Nations.  She is doing a spectacular job.  It's early, but she has just been really great. We're here today to celebrate American engineering and American manufacturing.  We're also here today to celebrate jobs.  Jobs.  (Applause.)  This plane, as you know, was built right here in the great state of South Carolina.  Our goal as a nation must be to rely less on imports and more on products made right here in the U.S.A.  (Applause.) It’s amazing to think that a little over 113 years ago, next door, in North Carolina, Orville Wright was the first man to sail the skies in a very little airplane.  The 1903 Wright Flyer was made of mostly wood and cloth.  It was so small that Orville's brother, Wilbur, could not join him on the flight.  He was always very upset about that.  The flight lasted all of 12 seconds, but it was incredible.   That flight was a testament to the American spirit.  I see that same spirit everywhere I travel in the country.  I saw that spirit all throughout the campaign.  We have the greatest people anywhere in the world.  We have the greatest spirit, and you just look at what's going on today in our country -- you look at what's happening with jobs.  You look at what's happening with plants moving back into our country.  All of a sudden, they're coming back.  And they're going to be very happy about it, believe me.  (Applause.)  They're going to be very, very happy.  (Applause.) As your President, I am going to do everything I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and to put our great people back to work.  (Applause.)  This is our mantra: Buy American and Hire American.  (Applause.)  We want products made in America, made by American hands.  You probably saw the Keystone pipeline I approved recently, and the Dakota.  And I’m getting ready to sign the bill.  I said, where is the pipe made?  And they told me not here.  I said, that's good -- add a little sentence that you have to buy American steel.  (Applause.)  And you know what?  That's the way it is.  It’s the way it’s going to be.  We are going to fight for every last American job.  We’ve come a long way since the Wright Brothers and their first flight more than a century ago.  Your plane is made of carbon fiber.  It seats 330 passengers.  It’s 18 feet longer than the previous version of the 787.  And this airplane can fly for half a day before it touches the ground.  The name says it all: Dreamliner.  Great name.  Our country is all about making dreams come true. Over the last number of years, that hasn’t been necessarily the case, but we're going to make it the case again.  (Applause.)  That’s what we do in America –- we dream of things, and then we build them.  We turn vision into reality, and we will be doing a lot more of that, believe me, in the months and years to come.  (Applause.)  I also want to say a word to all of the members of the armed forces who are here with us today in this record crowd.  (Applause.)     South Carolina has a long, very, very, proud military tradition and history.  We salute all South Carolina military families, and we salute all the men and women who wear the uniform.  (Applause.) We are going to fully rebuild our military -- by the way, do you care if we use the F-18 Super Hornets?  (Applause.)  Or do you only care about -- what do you think?  Well -- (jet flies overhead) -- thought that was a Super Hornet.  (Laughter.)  We are looking seriously at a big order, and we’ll see how that -- you know the problem is that Dennis is a very, very tough negotiator.  (Laughter.)  But I think we may get there. We're also working on the Air Force One project, which was a difficult project for previous administrations.  But it looks like we're getting closer and closer.  (Applause.)  And we’re going to ensure that our great service members have the tools, equipment, training and resources they need to get the job done.  (Applause.)  As George Washington said, being prepared for war is the best way to prevent it.  And that's really what it is:  The best way to prevent war, being prepared.  Peace through strength.  We build a military might so great -- and we are going to do that -- that none will dare to challenge it.  None.  (Applause.)  We will ensure our men and women in uniform have the latest, the most cutting edge systems in their arsenal.  Right now it’s not that way.  It will be that way very, very soon.  Believe me.  You will be an important player in this effort. Boeing has built many important aircraft -- including, as I said, the F-18 Super Hornet, the F-15 Strike Eagle, and the Apache helicopter, just to name a few.  (Applause.)   And I’m being very, very serious -- the new Air Force One, that plane, as beautiful as it looks, is 30 years old.  Can you believe it?  What can look so beautiful at 30?  An airplane. (Laughter.)  I don't know.  Which one do we like better folks?  Tell me.  (Applause.) On every front, we are going to work for the American people.  Nowhere in our focus -- and I mean this so strongly -- and our focus has to be so strong, but my focus has been all about jobs.  And jobs is one of the primary reasons I’m standing here today as your President, and I will never, ever disappoint you.  Believe me.  I will not disappoint you.  (Applause.)  I campaigned on the promise that I will do everything in my power to bring those jobs back into America.  We wanted to make much easier -- it has to be much easier to manufacture in our country and much harder to leave.  I don't want companies leaving our country, making their product, selling it back, no tax, no nothing, firing everybody in our country.  We're not letting that happen anymore, folks.  Believe me.  There will be a very substantial penalty to be paid when they fire their people and move to another country, make the product, and think that they're going to sell it back over what will soon be a very, very strong border.  Going to be a lot different.  It’s going to be a lot different.  (Applause.)  Already American industry will come roaring back.  And believe me if we -- not me, I’m a messenger -- if we didn't have this victory, we wouldn’t be even talking about it.  To achieve that goal, we’re going to massively reduce job-crushing regulations -- already started; you've seen that -- that send our jobs to those other countries.  We are going to lower taxes on American business so it’s cheaper and easier to produce product and beautiful things like airplanes right here in America.  (Applause.)  We are going to enforce -- very strongly enforce our trade rules and stop foreign cheating.  Tremendous cheating.  Tremendous cheating.  We want products made by our workers, in our factories, stamped with those four magnificent words:  Made in the USA.  (Applause.)  AUDIENCE:  U-S-A!  U-S-A!  U-S-A! THE PRESIDENT:  Since November, jobs have already begun to surge.  We’re seeing companies open up factories in America.  We’re seeing them keep jobs at home.  Ford, General Motors, Fiat-Chrysler -- just to name a very, very few.  So many more already.  They are keeping and bringing thousands of jobs back in country because the business climate, they know, has already changed.    In Arizona, Intel announced it will open a new plant that will create 10,000 American jobs.  They are spending billions of dollars.  (Applause.)     We will see more and more of that across the country as we continue to work on reducing regulations, cutting taxes -- including for the middle class, including for everyone, and including for business -- and creating a level playing field for our workers.  When there is a level playing field, and I’ve been saying this for a long time, American workers will always, always, always win.  But we don’t have a level playing field.  Very shortly, you will have a level playing field again.  (Applause.)  Because when American workers win, America as a country wins -- big league wins.    That’s my message here today.  America is going to start winning again -- winning like never, ever before.  We are not going to let our country be taken advantage of anymore in any way, shape or form.  We love America, and we are going to protect America.  We love our workers, and we are going to protect our workers.  We are going to fight for our jobs, we are going to fight for our families and we are going to fight to get more jobs and better-paying jobs for the loyal citizens of our country.  Believe me.  (Applause.)     You’ve heard me say it before, and I will say it again:  From now on, it’s going to be America first.  (Applause.)  Working together as a unit, there is nothing we cannot accomplish -- no task too large, no dream too great, no goal beyond our reach.  Just like you built this incredible airplane behind me -- both of them, when you think about it -- we are going to rebuild this country and ensure that every forgotten community has the bright future it deserves.  And by the way, those communities are forgotten no longer.  The election took care of that.  (Applause.)     And we will pass on to our children the freedom and prosperity that is their American birthright.  Our children will inherit from us a nation that is strong, that is proud and that is totally free.  And each of you will be part of creating that new American future.    I want to thank you, South Carolina.  I want to thank the great people of South Carolina.  God bless you, may God bless the United States of America, and God bless Boeing.  (Applause.)   Thank you, everybody.  Thank you.

Trump signed legislation (House Joint Resolution 41) eliminating a costly regulation that threatened to put domestic extraction companies and their employees at an unfair disadvantage. H.J. Res. 41 blocks a misguided regulation from burdening American extraction companies. By halting this regulation, the President has removed a costly impediment to American extraction companies helping their workers succeed. This legislation could save American businesses as much as $600 million annually in regulatory compliance costs and spare them 200,000 hours of paperwork. The regulation created an unfair advantage for foreign-owned extraction companies. BUILDING ON PRESIDENTIAL ACTION: President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on everyday Americans, their pocketbooks, and their businesses. President Trump has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated. President Trump will initiate fundamental changes to the United States healthcare system to reduce the financial burden on Americans by getting the government out of the way. President Trump has placed a moratorium on all new regulations by executive departments and agencies that are not compelled by Congress or public safety. President Trump directed his Secretary of Commerce to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing and to reduce regulatory burdens on domestic manufacturers. President Trump signed an Executive Order expediting the environmental review and approval processes for domestic infrastructure projects. President Trump directed the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a full review of Dodd-Frank to ensure associated, burdensome regulations receive proper scrutiny. President Trump ordered re-examination of the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule, to make certain that it does not harm Americans as they save for retirement.

EST THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I am delighted to welcome everybody to the White House.  And Betsy DeVos, who has gone through -- our new Education Secretary -- she went through an interesting moment.  And you're going to do a fantastic job, and I know you would have done it again if you had to do it again, right?  (Laughter.)  SECRETARY DEVOS:  Probably. THE PRESIDENT:  She had no doubt that final night, waiting for the vote.  So I just want to congratulate you.  You showed toughness and genius. As I said many times in my campaign, we want every child in America to have the opportunity to climb the ladder to success.  I want every child also to have a safe community, and we're going to do that very much.  We're going to be helping you a lot -- a great school and some day to get a really well-paying job or better, or better; own their own company.  And a lot of people are looking at that.   But it all begins with education, and that's why we're here this morning.  And I'm here also to celebrate a little bit with Betsy because we started this journey a long time ago, having to do with change and so many other good things with education.  And I'm so happy that that all worked out. Right now, too many of our children don't have the opportunity to get that education that we all talk about.  Millions of poor, disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools and this crisis -- and it really is a crisis -- of education and communities working together but not working out.  And we're going to change it around, especially for the African American communities.  It's been very, very tough and unfair.  And I know that's a priority and it's a certainly a priority of mine. That's why I want every single disadvantaged child in America, no matter what their background or where they live, to have a choice about where they go to school.  And it's worked out so well in some communities where it's been properly run and properly done.  And it's a terrific thing. Charter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results.  And you look at the results -- we have cases in New York City that have been amazing in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of so many different schools that I can name throughout the country that I got to see during the campaign.  I went to one in Las Vegas; it was the most unbelievable thing you've ever seen.  And they've done a fantastic job. So there are many such schools and we want to do that on a large-scale basis.  We can never lose sight of the connection between education and jobs.  I'm bringing a lot of jobs back.  We're bringing a lot of big plants back into the country -- everyone said it was impossible.  And before I even took office, we started the process and tremendous numbers of plants are coming back into this country -- car plants and other plants.  And I have meetings next week with four or five different companies, big ones that are going to bring massive numbers of jobs back.   So we're doing it from the jobs standpoint, but education only makes it better.  Our goal is a clear and very safe community, great schools, and we want those jobs that are high-paying jobs -- we've lost a lot of our best jobs to other countries and we're going to bring them back.   So I’m going to do my job, and Betsy, at the education level, will do her job.  And just to do it very, very formally, I want to congratulate you on having gone through a very tough trial and a very unfair trial, and you won.  And there’s something very nice about that.  And I’ll tell you the real winner will be the children -- I guess a couple of adults (inaudible) -- but will be the children of this country.  And I just want to congratulate you. SECRETARY DEVOS:  Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT:  Perhaps we’ll go around the room.  And everybody knows our fantastic Vice President, Mike Pence.  But if we went around the room, it would be very nice.  So why don’t we start?  Betsy, you might want to say a few words to us. SECRETARY DEVOS:  Well, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I am just very honored to have the opportunity to serve America’s students, and I’m really excited to be here today with parents and educators representing traditional public schools, charter public schools, homeschools, private schools, a range of choices.  And we’re eager to listen and learn from you your ideas for how we can ensure that all of our kids have an equal opportunity for a high-quality, great education and therefore an opportunity for the future. So again, I just wanted to have the opportunity to serve, and looking forward to fulfilling the mission that you set forward. THE PRESIDENT:  It’s our honor -- believe me, Betsy. Kenneth. MR. SMITH:  Ken Smith, educator helping at-risk kids get through school.  Vice President, it actually has the largest application of jobs for America’s graduates in the country.  And in a minute we’ll talk about that as a solution. THE PRESIDENT:  Great.  Good. Laura. MS. PARRISH:  Laura Parrish, I’m from Falls Church, Virginia.  I homeschool my 10- and my 13-year-old.   THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Very good. Mary. MS. RINER:  My name is Mary.  I’m a charter school parent here in D.C., and considered the best school in America. THE PRESIDENT:  You think, huh?  (Laughter.)   MS. RINER:  I know.   THE PRESIDENT:  I like that.   MS. RINER:  According to U.S. News & World Report. THE PRESIDENT:  Really?  Is that right?  Wow. Jennifer. MS. COLEMAN:  I am Jennifer Coleman.  I am from Prince William County, Virginia.  I am the mother of six, and I homeschool my oldest four; they are grades kindergarten through seven.  And before that I was a private school teacher. THE PRESIDENT:  Very good. MR. CIRENZA:  Bartholomew Cirenza.  I’m a parent of seven, and my kids have gone through both private and public school, and I see differences, and -- THE PRESIDENT:  Big difference. MR. CIRENZA:  Big difference. THE PRESIDENT:  Okay. MS. BAUMANN:  Good morning, I’m Julie.  I teach special education at a public school in New Jersey. THE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Thank you. MS. QUENNVILLE:  Hi, I’m Jane Quennville, and I’m a principal of a special-ed center in Virginia serving children ages five through twenty-two with autism and physical and medically fragile conditions. THE PRESIDENT:  How is that going? MS. QUENNVILLE:  Well -- THE PRESIDENT:  Have you seen an increase in the autism with the children? MS. QUENNVILLE:  Yes, yes.  In fact, our school has shifted its population -- saw more children with autism, definitely. THE PRESIDENT:  So what’s going on with autism?  When you look at the tremendous increases, really, it’s such an incredible -- it’s like really a horrible thing to watch, the tremendous amount of increase.  Do you have any idea?  And you’re seeing it in the school?  MS. QUENNVILLE:  Yes, I think -- I mean, I think the statistics, I believe, are 1 in 66, 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with autism. THE PRESIDENT:  And now it’s going to be even lower -- MS. QUENNVILLE:  Probably. THE PRESIDENT:  -- which is just amazing.  Well, maybe we can do something. MS. BONILLA:  I am Carol Bonilla.  I teach Spanish in a private elementary school in Arlington.  I teach the students in fourth through eighth grade. THE PRESIDENT:  Very good.  Thank you. MS. VIANA:  Good morning, Mr. Vice President, Mr. President.  My name is Aimee Viana.  I’m the parent of two children -- fifth grade and second grade -- and I live right outside of Raleigh, North Carolina in Cary, and I’m also a former educator in public and private schools. THE PRESIDENT:  Fantastic.  Thank you.  So thank you all very much.  Let’s get going. END  10:58 P.M.

Trump Vice President Mike Pence First Lady Melania Trump Mrs. Karen Pence The Cabinet Vice President Mike Pence Michael R. Pence is the 48th and current Vice President of the United States. Michael R. Pence was born in Columbus, Indiana, on June 7, 1959, one of six children born to Edward and Nancy Pence. As a young boy he had a front row seat to the American Dream. After his grandfather immigrated to the United States when he was 17, his family settled in the Midwest. The future Vice President watched his Mom and Dad build everything that matters – a family, a business, and a good name. Sitting at the feet of his mother and his father, who started a successful convenience store business in their small Indiana town, he was raised to believe in the importance of hard work, faith, and family. Vice President Pence set off for Hanover College, earning his bachelor’s degree in history in 1981. While there, he renewed his Christian faith which remains the driving force in his life. He later attended Indiana University School of Law and met the love of his life, Second Lady Karen Pence. After graduating, Vice President Pence practiced law, led the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, and began hosting The Mike Pence Show, a syndicated talk radio show and a weekly television public affairs program in Indiana. Along the way he became the proud father to three children, Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey. Growing up in Indiana, surrounded by good, hardworking Hoosiers, Vice President Pence always knew that he needed to give back to the state and the country that had given him so much. In 2000, he launched a successful bid for his local congressional seat, entering the United States House of Representatives at the age of 40. The people of East-Central Indiana elected Vice President Pence six times to represent them in Congress. On Capitol Hill he established himself as a champion of limited government, fiscal responsibility, economic development, educational opportunity, and the U.S. Constitution. His colleagues quickly recognized his leadership ability and unanimously elected him to serve as Chairman of the House Republican Study Committee and House Republican Conference Chairman. In this role, the Vice President helped make government smaller and more effective, reduce spending, and return power to state and local governments. In 2013, Vice President Pence left the nation’s capital when Hoosiers elected him the 50th Governor of Indiana. He brought the same limited government and low tax philosophy to the Indiana Statehouse. As Governor, he enacted the largest income tax cut in Indiana history, lowering individual income tax rates, the business personal property tax, and the corporate income tax in order to strengthen the State’s competitive edge and attract new investment and good-paying jobs. Due to his relentless focus on jobs, the state’s unemployment rate fell by half during his four years in office, and at the end of his term, more Hoosiers were working than at any point in the state’s 200-year history. As Governor of Indiana, Vice President Pence increased school funding, expanded school choice, and created the first state-funded Pre-K plan in Indiana history. He made career and technical education a priority in every high school. Under Vice President Pence’s leadership, Indiana, known as “The Crossroads of America,” invested more than $800 million in new money for roads and bridges across the state. Despite the record tax cuts and new investments in roads and schools, the state remained fiscally responsible, as the Vice President worked with members of the Indiana General Assembly to pass two honestly balanced budgets that left the state with strong reserves and AAA credit ratings that were the envy of the nation. It was Indiana’s success story, Vice President Pence’s record of legislative and executive experience, and his strong family values that prompted President Donald Trump to select Mike Pence as his running mate in July 2016. The American people elected President Donald Trump and Vice President Pence on November 8, 2016. President Donald Trump and Vice President Pence entered office on January 20, 2017. Vice President Mike Pence remains grateful for the grace of God, the love and support of his family, and the blessings of liberty that are every American’s birthright. He looks forward to working with the American people as together they seek to Make America Great Again. Follow the Office of the Vice President on Twitter at @VP.

These groups are drivers of crime, corruption, violence, and misery.  In particular, the trafficking by cartels of controlled substances has triggered a resurgence in deadly drug abuse and a corresponding rise in violent crime related to drugs.  Likewise, the trafficking and smuggling of human beings by transnational criminal groups risks creating a humanitarian crisis.  These crimes, along with many others, are enriching and empowering these organizations to the detriment of the American people. A comprehensive and decisive approach is required to dismantle these organized crime syndicates and restore safety for the American people. Sec. 2.  Policy.  It shall be the policy of the executive branch to: (a)  strengthen enforcement of Federal law in order to thwart transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including criminal gangs, cartels, racketeering organizations, and other groups engaged in illicit activities that present a threat to public safety and national security and that are related to, for example:  (i)    the illegal smuggling and trafficking of humans, drugs or other substances, wildlife, and weapons; (ii)   corruption, cybercrime, fraud, financial crimes, and intellectual-property theft; or (iii)  the illegal concealment or transfer of proceeds derived from such illicit activities. (b)  ensure that Federal law enforcement agencies give a high priority and devote sufficient resources to efforts to identify, interdict, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including through the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of members of such organizations, the extradition of members of such organizations to face justice in the United States and, where appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, the swift removal from the United States of foreign nationals who are members of such organizations; (c)  maximize the extent to which all Federal agencies share information and coordinate with Federal law enforcement agencies, as permitted by law, in order to identify, interdict, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations; (d)  enhance cooperation with foreign counterparts against transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including, where appropriate and permitted by law, through sharing of intelligence and law enforcement information and through increased security sector assistance to foreign partners by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security;  (e)  develop strategies, under the guidance of the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to maximize coordination among agencies -- such as through the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF), Special Operations Division, the OCDETF Fusion Center, and the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center -- to counter the crimes described in subsection (a) of this section, consistent with applicable Federal law; and (f)  pursue and support additional efforts to prevent the operational success of transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations within and beyond the United States, to include prosecution of ancillary criminal offenses, such as immigration fraud and visa fraud, and the seizure of the implements of such organizations and forfeiture of the proceeds of their criminal activity. Sec. 3.  Implementation.  In furtherance of the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, or their designees, shall co chair and direct the existing interagency Threat Mitigation Working Group (TMWG), which shall: (a)  work to support and improve the coordination of Federal agencies' efforts to identify, interdict, investigate, prosecute, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations within and beyond the United States; (b)  work to improve Federal agencies' provision, collection, reporting, and sharing of, and access to, data relevant to Federal efforts against transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations; (c)  work to increase intelligence and law enforcement information sharing with foreign partners battling transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, and to enhance international operational capabilities and cooperation; (d)  assess Federal agencies' allocation of monetary and personnel resources for identifying, interdicting, and dismantling transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, as well as any resources that should be redirected toward these efforts; (e)  identify Federal agencies' practices, any absence of practices, and funding needs that might hinder Federal efforts to effectively combat transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations; (f)  review relevant Federal laws to determine existing ways in which to identify, interdict, and disrupt the activity of transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, and ascertain which statutory authorities, including provisions under the Immigration and Nationality Act, could be better enforced or amended to prevent foreign members of these organizations or their associates from obtaining entry into the United States and from exploiting the United States immigration system; (g)  in the interest of transparency and public safety, and in compliance with all applicable law, including the Privacy Act, issue reports at least once per quarter detailing convictions in the United States relating to transnational criminal organizations and their subsidiaries; (h)  to the extent deemed useful by the Co-Chairs, and in their discretion, identify methods for Federal agencies to coordinate, as permitted by law, with State, tribal, and local governments and law enforcement agencies, foreign law enforcement partners, public-health organizations, and non governmental organizations in order to aid in the identification, interdiction, and dismantling of transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations; (i)  to the extent deemed useful by the Co-Chairs, and in their discretion, consult with the Office of National Drug Control Policy in implementing this order; and (j)  within 120 days of the date of this order, submit to the President a report on transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including the extent of penetration of such organizations into the United States, and issue additional reports annually thereafter to describe the progress made in combating these criminal organizations, along with any recommended actions for dismantling them. Sec. 4.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Johnson, the White House Fellows program is one of America's most prestigious programs for leadership and public service. White House Fellowships offer exceptional young men and women first-hand experience working at the highest levels of the federal government. Selected individuals typically spend a year working as a full-time, paid Fellow to senior White House Staff, Cabinet Secretaries and other top-ranking government officials. Fellows also participate in an education program consisting of roundtable discussions with renowned leaders from the private and public sectors, and trips to study U.S. policy in action both domestically and internationally. Fellowships are awarded on a strictly non-partisan basis. Purpose Adopted in 1965 by the President's Commission on White House Fellowships: The purpose of the White House Fellows program is to provide gifted and highly motivated young Americans with some first-hand experience in the process of governing the Nation and a sense of personal involvement in the leadership of society. It is essential to the healthy functioning of our system that we have in the non-governmental sector a generous supply of leaders who have an understanding -- gained first hand -- of the challenges that our national government faces. In a day when the individual feels increasingly remote from the centers of power and decision-making, such leaders can help their fellow citizens comprehend the process by which the Nation is governed. In this country today, we produce a great number of skilled professionals. But too few of this intellectual elite provide the society with statesmanlike leadership and guidance in public affairs. Surely the raw material is still there. And just as surely more must be done in the development of our best young people to inspire and facilitate the emergence of such leaders and statesmen. Their horizons and experience must be broadened to give them a sense of personal involvement in the leadership of society, a vision of greatness for the society, and a sense of responsibility for bringing that greatness to reality. The White House Fellows Program is designed to give superbly qualified young Americans precisely those experiences. History Declaring that ""a genuinely free society cannot be a spectator society,"" President Lyndon B. Johnson announced the establishment of the White House Fellows Program in the East Room of the White House in October 1964. Prompted by the suggestion of John W. Gardner, then President of the Carnegie Corporation, President Johnson's intent was to draw individuals of exceptionally high promise to Washington for one year of personal involvement in the process of government. The White House Fellowship was created as a non-partisan program. It has strictly maintained this tradition during both Republican and Democratic administrations and, through the cross-fertilization of ideas and experience, has enriched the practice of public policy for more than five decades. The mission of the non-partisan White House Fellows Program, as envisioned by President Johnson, was in his words, ""to give the Fellows first hand, high-level experience with the workings of the Federal government and to increase their sense of participation in national affairs."" In return for the Fellowship year, President Johnson expected the Fellows to ""repay that privilege"" when they left by ""continuing to work as private citizens on their public agendas."" He hoped that the Fellows would contribute to the nation as future leaders. Today, the mission remains the same: to encourage active citizenship and service to the Nation.

He was the first Vice President to succeed to the Presidency after the death of his predecessor.  Dubbed ""His Accidency"" by his detractors, John Tyler was the first Vice President to be elevated to the office of President by the death of his predecessor. Born in Virginia in 1790, he was raised believing that the Constitution must be strictly construed. He never wavered from this conviction. He attended the College of William and Mary and studied law. Serving in the House of Representatives from 1816 to 1821, Tyler voted against most nationalist legislation and opposed the Missouri Compromise. After leaving the House he served as Governor of Virginia. As a Senator he reluctantly supported Jackson for President as a choice of evils. Tyler soon joined the states' rights Southerners in Congress who banded with Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and their newly formed Whig party opposing President Jackson. The Whigs nominated Tyler for Vice President in 1840, hoping for support from southern states'-righters who could not stomach Jacksonian Democracy. The slogan ""Tippecanoe and Tyler Too"" implied flag waving nationalism plus a dash of southern sectionalism. Clay, intending to keep party leadership in his own hands, minimized his nationalist views temporarily; Webster proclaimed himself ""a Jeffersonian Democrat."" But after the election, both men tried to dominate ""Old Tippecanoe."" Suddenly President Harrison was dead, and ""Tyler too"" was in the White House. At first the Whigs were not too disturbed, although Tyler insisted upon assuming the full powers of a duly elected President. He even delivered an Inaugural Address, but it seemed full of good Whig doctrine. Whigs, optimistic that Tyler would accept their program, soon were disillusioned. Tyler was ready to compromise on the banking question, but Clay would not budge. He would not accept Tyler's ""exchequer system,"" and Tyler vetoed Clay's bill to establish a National Bank with branches in several states. A similar bank bill was passed by Congress. But again, on states' rights grounds, Tyler vetoed it. In retaliation, the Whigs expelled Tyler from their party. All the Cabinet resigned but Secretary of State Webster. A year later when Tyler vetoed a tariff bill, the first impeachment resolution against a President was introduced in the House of Representatives. A committee headed by Representative John Quincy Adams reported that the President had misused the veto power, but the resolution failed. Despite their differences, President Tyler and the Whig Congress enacted much positive legislation. The ""Log-Cabin"" bill enabled a settler to claim 160 acres of land before it was offered publicly for sale, and later pay $1.25 an acre for it. In 1842 Tyler did sign a tariff bill protecting northern manufacturers. The Webster-Ashburton treaty ended a Canadian boundary dispute; in 1845 Texas was annexed. The administration of this states'-righter strengthened the Presidency. But it also increased sectional cleavage that led toward civil war. By the end of his term, Tyler had replaced the original Whig Cabinet with southern conservatives. In 1844 Calhoun became Secretary of State. Later these men returned to the Democratic Party, committed to the preservation of states' rights, planter interests, and the institution of slavery. Whigs became more representative of northern business and farming interests. When the first southern states seceded in 1861, Tyler led a compromise movement; failing, he worked to create the Southern Confederacy. He died in 1862, a member of the Confederate House of Representatives.

Johnson. A shrewd investor and manager, she broke ground for the role by interacting with Congress directly and advocating strongly for beautifying the nation's cities and highways. Christened Claudia Alta Taylor when she was born in a country mansion near Karnack, Texas, she received her nickname ""Lady Bird"" as a small child; and as Lady Bird she was known and loved throughout America. Perhaps that name was prophetic, as there has seldom been a First Lady so attuned to nature and the importance of conserving the environment. Her mother, Minnie Pattillo Taylor, died when Lady Bird was five, so she was reared by her father, her aunt, and family servants. From her father, Thomas Jefferson Taylor, who had prospered, she learned much about the business world. An excellent student, she also learned to love classical literature. At the University of Texas she earned a bachelor's degree in arts and in journalism. In 1934 Lady Bird met Lyndon Baines Johnson, then a Congressional secretary visiting Austin on official business; he promptly asked her for a date, which she accepted. He courted her from Washington with letters, telegrams, and telephone calls. Seven weeks later he was back in Texas; he proposed to her and she accepted. In her own words: ""Sometimes Lyndon simply takes your breath away."" They were married in November 1934. The years that followed were devoted to Lyndon's political career, with ""Bird"" as partner, confidante, and helpmate. She helped keep his Congressional office open during World War II when he volunteered for naval service; and in 1955, when he had a severe heart attack, she helped his staff keep things running smoothly until he could return to his post as Majority Leader of the Senate. He once remarked that voters ""would happily have elected her over me."" After repeated miscarriages, she gave birth to Lynda Bird (now Mrs. Charles S. Robb) in 1944; Luci Baines (Mrs. Ian Turpin) was born three years later. In the election of 1960, Lady Bird successfully stumped for Democratic candidates across 35,000 miles of campaign trail. As wife of the Vice President, she became an ambassador of goodwill by visiting 33 foreign countries. Moving to the White House after Kennedy's murder, she did her best to ease a painful transition. She soon set her own stamp of Texas hospitality on social events, but these were not her chief concern. She created a First Lady's Committee for a More Beautiful Capital, then expanded her program to include the entire nation. She took a highly active part in her husband's war-on-poverty program, especially the Head Start project for preschool children. When the Presidential term ended, the Johnsons returned to Texas, where he died in 1973. Mrs. Johnson's White House Diary, published in 1970, and a 1981 documentary film, The First Lady, A Portrait of Lady Bird Johnson, give sensitive and detailed views of her contributions to the President's Great Society administration. Lady Bird lead a life devoted to her husband's memory, her children, and seven grandchildren. She supported causes dear to her--notably the National Wildflower Research Center, which she founded in 1982, and The Lyndon Baines Johnson Library. She also served on the Board of the National Geographic Society as a trustee emeritus.

EST    THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody, for being here today.  It is with great pride, very great pride, that I say these words to you right now:  Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  (Applause.)  Welcome to the White House.  (Applause.)      I want to congratulate you, Jeff, your wife Mary, and your entire family.  Jeff Sessions has been a federal prosecutor at the highest level and at the most respected level, a state attorney general, and then a U.S. senator for two decades.  He has devoted his life to the cause of justice and believes deeply that all people are equals in the eyes of the law -- and very importantly for Jeff and for so many of us, also in the eyes of God.    He’s a man of integrity, a man of principle, and a man of total, utter resolve.  You just got a little witnessing of that.  That resolve is what we need right now.  America faces many challenges.  We face the menace of rising crime and the threat of deadly terror.  And it’s not getting better, but it will get better very soon.  It’s going to get a lot better.    These dangerous times require a determined attorney general, which is what Jeff is.  Jeff understands that the job of attorney general is to serve and protect the people of the United States, and that is exactly what he will do, and do better than anybody else can.  He’s trained better for it than anybody else.  The level of respect that he has throughout this country as a former prosecutor, not even to mention being a long-time U.S. senator, is absolutely incredible.    He will be a great protector of the people.  I’m signing three executive actions today designed to restore safety in America.  These executive actions continue to deliver on my campaign promises.     First, I’m directing Department of Justice and Homeland Security to undertake all necessary and lawful action to break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and are destroying the blood of our youth and other people, many other people.    Secondly, I’m directing Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime in America.      And thirdly, I’m directing the Department of Justice to implement a plan to stop crime and crimes of violence against law enforcement officers.  It’s a shame what’s been happening to our great, truly great law enforcement officers.  That’s going to stop as of today.    Today’s ceremony should be seen as a clear message to the gang members and drug dealers terrorizing innocent people.  Your day is over.  A new era of justice begins, and it begins right now.      I want to again thank and congratulate Mary and our new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.  I wish you God’s wisdom and blessings in your journey.  Mr. Vice President, would you please conduct the swearing-in.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for being here, everyone.  (Applause.)      (The Attorney General is sworn in.)    ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS:  Mr. President, thank you for this great honor.  It’s something I never expected would happen in my life, but I do love the Department of Justice.  I care about its traditions and its heritage.  I had 15 years in that great department, and the honor to lead it now is something that I do not have words to express effectively.    There are a lot of things we need to do.  First, we need to value and support and encourage the fabulous people who work there.  I’ve worked with them over the years.  I know how good they are, and their talents need to be directed at this nation’s benefit in a lot of different ways.  We have a crime problem.  I wish the blip -- I wish the rise that we are seeing in crime in America today were some sort of aberration or a blip.  My best judgement, having been involved in criminal law enforcement for many years is that this is a dangerous, permanent trend that places the health and safety of the American people at risk.  We will deploy the talents and abilities of the Department of Justice in the most effective way possible to confront this rise in crime and to protect the people of our country.    We have an increased threat, since I was a United States attorney, from terrorism.  Mr. President, you’ve spoken firmly on that.  You’ve led this nation to say we’re going to respond effectively to the threat of terrorism, and you can count on your Department of Justice to do so in an effective way.  And you’ve said something that I believe and I think the American people believe -- that we need a lawful system of immigration; one that serves the interests of the people of the United States.  That’s not wrong, that’s not immoral, that’s not indecent.  We admit a million people a year plus, lawfully, and we need to end this lawlessness that threatens the public safety, pulls down wages of working Americans.      It is an honor beyond words to serve under you and your leadership.  You’re putting together a great Cabinet, which is just a thrill for me to have the opportunity to join.  And I look forward to making sure that every ounce of strength I have and that the people of the Department of Justice have is going to be focused on preserving and protecting the Constitution and the safety of this country.  We will defend the laws of this country as passed by Congress.  We will defend the lawful orders of the President of the United States with vigor and determination.      Thank you all for being here, I see a lot of good friends, and may God bless all our efforts.  Thank you.  (Applause.)     END  11:07 A.M.

She served as First Lady of the United States from 1897 to 1901. There was little resemblance between the vivacious young woman who married William McKinley in January 1871--a slender bride with sky-blue eyes and fair skin and masses of auburn hair--and the petulant invalid who moved into the White House with him in March 1897. Now her face was pallid and drawn, her close-cropped hair gray; her eyes were glazed with pain or dulled with sedative. Only one thing had remained the same: love which had brightened early years of happiness and endured through more than twenty years of illness. Ida had been born in Canton, Ohio, in 1847, elder daughter of a socially prominent and well-to-do family. James A. Saxton, a banker, was indulgent to his two daughters. He educated them well in local schools and a finishing school, and then sent them to Europe on the grand tour. Being pretty, fashionable, and a leader of the younger set in Canton did not satisfy Ida, so her broad-minded father suggested that she work in his bank. As a cashier she caught the attention of Maj. William McKinley, who had come to Canton in 1867 to establish a law practice, and they fell deeply in love. While he advanced in his profession, his young wife devoted her time to home and husband. A daughter, Katherine, was born on Christmas Day, 1871; a second, in April 1873. This time Ida was seriously ill, and the frail baby died in August. Phlebitis and epileptic seizures shattered the mother's health; and even before little Katie died in 1876, she was a confirmed invalid. As Congressman and then as governor of Ohio, William McKinley was never far from her side. He arranged their life to suit her convenience. She spent most of her waking hours in a small Victorian rocking chair that she had had since childhood; she sat doing fancy work and crocheting bedroom slippers while she waited for her husband, who indulged her every whim. At the White House, the McKinleys acted as if her health were no great handicap to her role as First Lady. Richly and prettily dressed, she received guests at formal receptions seated in a blue velvet chair. She held a fragrant bouquet to suggest that she would not shake hands. Contrary to protocol, she was seated beside the President at state dinners and he, as always, kept close watch for signs of an impending seizure. If necessary, he would cover her face with a large handkerchief for a moment. The First Lady and her devoted husband seemed oblivious to any social inadequacy. Guests were discreet and newspapers silent on the subject of her ""fainting spells."" Only in recent years have the facts of her health been revealed. When the President was shot by an assassin in September 1901, after his second inauguration, he thought primarily of her. He murmured to his secretary: ""My wife--be careful, Cortelyou, how you tell her--oh, be careful."" After his death, she lived in Canton, cared for by her younger sister, visiting her husband's grave almost daily. She died in 1907, and lies entombed beside the President and near their two little daughters in Canton's McKinley Memorial Mausoleum.

The power of the Executive Branch is vested in the President of the United States, who also acts as head of state and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. The President is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws written by Congress and, to that end, appoints the heads of the federal agencies, including the Cabinet. The Vice President is also part of the Executive Branch, ready to assume the Presidency should the need arise. The Cabinet and independent federal agencies are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement and administration of federal laws. These departments and agencies have missions and responsibilities as widely divergent as those of the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency, the Social Security Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Including members of the armed forces, the Executive Branch employs more than 4 million Americans. The President | The Vice President Executive Office of the President | The Cabinet The President The President is both the head of state and head of government of the United States of America, and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. Under Article II of the Constitution, the President is responsible for the execution and enforcement of the laws created by Congress. Fifteen executive departments — each led by an appointed member of the President's Cabinet — carry out the day-to-day administration of the federal government. They are joined in this by other executive agencies such as the CIA and Environmental Protection Agency, the heads of which are not part of the Cabinet, but who are under the full authority of the President. The President also appoints the heads of more than 50 independent federal commissions, such as the Federal Reserve Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as federal judges, ambassadors, and other federal offices. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) consists of the immediate staff to the President, along with entities such as the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The President has the power either to sign legislation into law or to veto bills enacted by Congress, although Congress may override a veto with a two-thirds vote of both houses. The Executive Branch conducts diplomacy with other nations, and the President has the power to negotiate and sign treaties, which also must be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate. The President can issue executive orders, which direct executive officers or clarify and further existing laws. The President also has unlimited power to extend pardons and clemencies for federal crimes, except in cases of impeachment. With these powers come several responsibilities, among them a constitutional requirement to ""from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient."" Although the President may fulfill this requirement in any way he or she chooses, Presidents have traditionally given a State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress each January (except in inaugural years) outlining their agenda for the coming year. The Constitution lists only three qualifications for the Presidency — the President must be 35 years of age, be a natural born citizen, and must have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. And though millions of Americans vote in a presidential election every four years, the President is not, in fact, directly elected by the people. Instead, on the first Tuesday in November of every fourth year, the people elect the members of the Electoral College. Apportioned by population to the 50 states — one for each member of their congressional delegation (with the District of Columbia receiving 3 votes) — these Electors then cast the votes for President. There are currently 538 electors in the Electoral College. President Barack Obama is the 44th President of the United States. He is, however, only the 43rd person ever to serve as President; President Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms, and thus is recognized as both the 22nd and the 24th President. Today, the President is limited to two four-year terms, but until the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1951, a President could serve an unlimited number of terms. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected President four times, serving from 1932 until his death in 1945; he is the only President ever to have served more than two terms. By tradition, the President and the First Family live in the White House in Washington, D.C., also the location of the President's Oval Office and the offices of the his senior staff. When the President travels by plane, his aircraft is designated Air Force One; he may also use a Marine Corps helicopter, known as Marine One while the President is on board. For ground travel, the President uses an armored Presidential limousine. The Vice President The primary responsibility of the Vice President of the United States is to be ready at a moment's notice to assume the Presidency if the President is unable to perform his duties. This can be because of the President's death, resignation, or temporary incapacitation, or if the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet judge that the President is no longer able to discharge the duties of the presidency. The Vice President is elected along with the President by the Electoral College — each elector casts one vote for President and another for Vice President. Before the ratification of the 12th Amendment in 1804, electors only voted for President, and the person who received the second greatest number of votes became Vice President. The Vice President also serves as the President of the United States Senate, where he or she casts the deciding vote in the case of a tie. Except in the case of tiebreaking votes, the Vice President rarely actually presides over the Senate. Instead, the Senate selects one of their own members, usually junior members of the majority party, to preside over the Senate each day. Joseph R. Biden is the 47th Vice President of the United States. Of the 45 previous Vice Presidents, nine have succeeded to the Presidency, and four have been elected to the Presidency in their own right. The duties of the Vice President, outside of those enumerated in the Constitution, are at the discretion of the current President. Each Vice President approaches the role differently — some take on a specific policy portfolio, others serve simply as a top adviser to the President. The Vice President has an office in the West Wing of the White House, as well as in the nearby Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Like the President, he also maintains an official residence, at the United States Naval Observatory in Northwest Washington, D.C. This peaceful mansion, has been the official home of the Vice President since 1974 — previously, Vice Presidents had lived in their own private residences. The Vice President also has his own limousine, operated by the United States Secret Service, and flies on the same aircraft the President uses — but when the Vice President is aboard, the craft are referred to as Air Force Two and Marine Two. Executive Office of the President Every day, the President of the United States is faced with scores of decisions, each with important consequences for America's future. To provide the President with the support that he or she needs to govern effectively, the Executive Office of the President (EOP) was created in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The EOP has responsibility for tasks ranging from communicating the President's message to the American people to promoting our trade interests abroad. The EOP, overseen by the White House Chief of Staff, has traditionally been home to many of the President's closest advisers. While Senate confirmation is required for some advisers, such as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, most are appointed with full Presidential discretion. The individual offices that these advisors oversee have grown in size and number since the EOP was created. Some were formed by Congress, others as the President has needed them — they are constantly shifting as each President identifies his needs and priorities, with the current EOP employing over 1,800 people. Perhaps the most visible parts of the EOP are the White House Communications Office and Press Secretary's Office. The Press Secretary provides daily briefings for the media on the President's activities and agenda. Less visible to most Americans is the National Security Council, which advises the President on foreign policy, intelligence, and national security. There are also a number of offices responsible for the practicalities of maintaining the White House and providing logistical support for the President. These include the White House Military Office, which is responsible for services ranging from Air Force One to the dining facilities, and the Office of Presidential Advance, which prepares sites remote from the White House for the President's arrival. Many senior advisors in the EOP work near the President in the West Wing of the White House. However, the majority of the staff is housed in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, just a few steps away and part of the White House compound. The Cabinet The Cabinet is an advisory body made up of the heads of the 15 executive departments. Appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the members of the Cabinet are often the President's closest confidants. In addition to running major federal agencies, they play an important role in the Presidential line of succession — after the Vice President, Speaker of the House, and Senate President pro tempore, the line of succession continues with the Cabinet offices in the order in which the departments were created. All the members of the Cabinet take the title Secretary, excepting the head of the Justice Department, who is styled Attorney General. Department of Agriculture The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) develops and executes policy on farming, agriculture, and food. Its aims include meeting the needs of farmers and ranchers, promoting agricultural trade and production, assuring food safety, protecting natural resources, fostering rural communities, and ending hunger in America and abroad. The USDA employs more than 100,000 employees and has an annual budget of approximately $95 billion. It consists of 17 agencies, including the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Food and Nutrition Service, and the Forest Service. The bulk of the department's budget goes towards mandatory programs that provide services required by law, such as programs designed to provide nutrition assistance, promote agricultural exports, and conserve our environment. The USDA also plays an important role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. The United States Secretary of Agriculture administers the USDA. Department of Commerce The Department of Commerce is the government agency tasked with improving living standards for all Americans by promoting economic development and technological innovation. The department supports U.S. business and industry through a number of services, including gathering economic and demographic data, issuing patents and trademarks, improving understanding of the environment and oceanic life, and ensuring the effective use of scientific and technical resources. The agency also formulates telecommunications and technology policy, and promotes U.S. exports by assisting and enforcing international trade agreements. The Secretary of Commerce oversees a $6.5 billion budget and approximately 38,000 employees. Department of Defense The mission of the Department of Defense (DOD) is to provide the military forces needed to deter war and to protect the security of our country. The department's headquarters is at the Pentagon. The DOD consists of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as many agencies, offices, and commands, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, the National Security Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency. The DOD occupies the vast majority of the Pentagon building in Arlington, VA. The Department of Defense is the largest government agency, with more than 1.3 million men and women on active duty, nearly 700,000 civilian personnel, and 1.1 million citizens who serve in the National Guard and Reserve forces. Together, the military and civilian arms of DOD protect national interests through war-fighting, providing humanitarian aid, and performing peacekeeping and disaster relief services. Department of Education The mission of the Department of Education is to promote student achievement and preparation for competition in a global economy by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access to educational opportunity. The Department administers federal financial aid for education, collects data on America's schools to guide improvements in education quality, and works to complement the efforts of state and local governments, parents, and students. The U.S. Secretary of Education oversees the Department's 4,200 employees and $68.6 billion budget. Department of Energy The mission of the Department of Energy (DOE) is to advance the national, economic, and energy security of the United States. The DOE promotes America's energy security by encouraging the development of reliable, clean, and affordable energy. It administers federal funding for scientific research to further the goal of discovery and innovation — ensuring American economic competitiveness and improving the quality of life for Americans. The DOE is also tasked with ensuring America's nuclear security, and with protecting the environment by providing a responsible resolution to the legacy of nuclear weapons production. The United States Secretary of Energy oversees a budget of approximately $23 billion and more than 100,000 federal and contract employees. Department of Health and Human Services The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. Agencies of HHS conduct health and social science research, work to prevent disease outbreaks, assure food and drug safety, and provide health insurance. In addition to administering Medicare and Medicaid, which together provide health insurance to one in four Americans, HHS also oversees the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control. The Secretary of Health and Human Services oversees a budget of approximately $700 billion and approximately 65,000 employees. The Department's programs are administered by 11 operating divisions, including 8 agencies in the U.S. Public Health Service and 3 human services agencies. Department of Homeland Security The missions of the Department of Homeland Security are to prevent and disrupt terrorist attacks; protect the American people, our critical infrastructure, and key resources; and respond to and recover from incidents that do occur. The third largest Cabinet department, DHS was established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, largely in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The new department consolidated 22 executive branch agencies, including the U.S. Customs Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. DHS employs 216,000 people in its mission to patrol borders, protect travelers and our transportation infrastructure, enforce immigration laws, and respond to disasters and emergencies. The agency also promotes preparedness and emergency prevention among citizens. Policy is coordinated by the Homeland Security Council at the White House, in cooperation with other defense and intelligence agencies, and led by the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. Department of Housing and Urban Development The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the federal agency responsible for national policies and programs that address America's housing needs, that improve and develop the nation's communities, and that enforce fair housing laws. The Department plays a major role in supporting homeownership for lower- and moderate-income families through its mortgage insurance and rent subsidy programs. Offices within HUD include the Federal Housing Administration, which provides mortgage and loan insurance; the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, which ensures all Americans equal access to the housing of their choice; and the Community Development Block Grant Program, which helps communities with economic development, job opportunities, and housing rehabilitation. HUD also administers public housing and homeless assistance. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development oversees approximately 9,000 employees on a budget of approximately $40 billion. Department of the Interior The Department of the Interior (DOI) is the nation's principal conservation agency. Its mission is to protect America's natural resources, offer recreation opportunities, conduct scientific research, conserve and protect fish and wildlife, and honor our trust responsibilities to American Indians, Alaskan Natives, and our responsibilities to island communities. DOI manages 500 million acres of surface land, or about one-fifth of the land in the United States, and manages hundreds of dams and reservoirs. Agencies within the DOI include the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Minerals Management Service, and the U.S. Geological Survey. The DOI manages the national parks and is tasked with protecting endangered species. The Secretary of the Interior oversees about 70,000 employees and 200,000 volunteers on a budget of approximately $16 billion. Every year it raises billions in revenue from energy, mineral, grazing, and timber leases, as well as recreational permits and land sales. Department of Justice The mission of the Department of Justice (DOJ) is to enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans. The DOJ is comprised of 40 component organizations, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Marshals, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Attorney General is the head of the DOJ and chief law enforcement officer of the federal government. The Attorney General represents the United States in legal matters, advises the President and the heads of the executive departments of the government, and occasionally appears in person before the Supreme Court. With a budget of approximately $25 billion, the DOJ is the world's largest law office and the central agency for the enforcement of federal laws. Department of Labor The Department of Labor oversees federal programs for ensuring a strong American workforce. These programs address job training, safe working conditions, minimum hourly wage and overtime pay, employment discrimination, and unemployment insurance. The Department of Labor's mission is to foster and promote the welfare of the job seekers, wage earners, and retirees of the United States by improving their working conditions, advancing their opportunities for profitable employment, protecting their retirement and health care benefits, helping employers find workers, strengthening free collective bargaining, and tracking changes in employment, prices, and other national economic measurements. Offices within the Department of Labor include the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government's principal statistics agency for labor economics, and the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, which promotes the safety and health of America's working men and women. The Secretary of Labor oversees 15,000 employees on a budget of approximately $50 billion. Department of State The Department of State plays the lead role in developing and implementing the President's foreign policy. Major responsibilities include United States representation abroad, foreign assistance, foreign military training programs, countering international crime, and a wide assortment of services to U.S. citizens and foreign nationals seeking entrance to the U.S. The U.S. maintains diplomatic relations with approximately 180 countries — each posted by civilian U.S. Foreign Service employees — as well as with international organizations. At home, more than 5,000 civil employees carry out the mission of the Department. The Secretary of State serves as the President's top foreign policy adviser, and oversees 30,000 employees and a budget of approximately $35 billion. Department of Transportation The mission of the Department of Transportation (DOT) is to ensure a fast, safe, efficient, accessible and convenient transportation system that meets our vital national interests and enhances the quality of life of the American people. Organizations within the DOT include the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration and the Maritime Administration. The U.S. Secretary of Transportation oversees approximately 55,000 employees and a budget of approximately $70 billion. Department of the Treasury The Department of the Treasury is responsible for promoting economic prosperity and ensuring the soundness and security of the U.S. and international financial systems. The Department operates and maintains systems that are critical to the nation's financial infrastructure, such as the production of coin and currency, the disbursement of payments to the American public, the collection of taxes, and the borrowing of funds necessary to run the federal government. The Department works with other federal agencies, foreign governments, and international financial institutions to encourage global economic growth, raise standards of living, and, to the extent possible, predict and prevent economic and financial crises. The Treasury Department also performs a critical and far-reaching role in enhancing national security by improving the safeguards of our financial systems, implementing economic sanctions against foreign threats to the U.S., and identifying and targeting the financial support networks of national security threats. The Secretary of the Treasury oversees a budget of approximately $13 billion and a staff of more than 100,000 employees. Department of Veterans Affairs The Department of Veterans Affairs is responsible for administering benefit programs for veterans, their families, and their survivors. These benefits include pension, education, disability compensation, home loans, life insurance, vocational rehabilitation, survivor support, medical care, and burial benefits. Veterans Affairs became a cabinet-level department in 1989. Of the 25 million veterans currently alive, nearly three of every four served during a war or an official period of hostility. About a quarter of the nation's population — approximately 70 million people — are potentially eligible for V.A. benefits and services because they are veterans, family members, or survivors of veterans. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs oversees a budget of approximately $90 billion and a staff of approximately 235,000 employees.   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

The President of the United States must be ready to travel anywhere in the world on a moment’s notice. Fortunately, modern Presidents have access to a variety of transportation options — including flying aboard Air Force One. Technically, Air Force One is used to describe any Air Force aircraft carrying the President — but since the middle of the 20th century, it has been standard practice to refer to specific planes that are equipped to transport the Commander-in-Chief. Today, this name refers to one of two highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft, which carry the tail codes 28000 and 29000. The Air Force designation for the aircraft is VC-25A. Air Force One is one of the most recognizable symbols of the presidency, spawning countless references not just in American culture but across the world. Emblazoned with the words ""United States of America,"" the American flag, and the Seal of the President of the United States, it is an undeniable presence wherever it flies. Capable of refueling midair, Air Force One has unlimited range and can carry the President wherever he needs to travel. The onboard electronics are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and Air Force One is equipped with advanced secure communications equipment, allowing the aircraft to function as a mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States. Inside, the President and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including an extensive suite for the President that features a large office, lavatory, and conference room. Air Force One includes a medical suite that can function as an operating room, and a doctor is permanently on board. The plane’s two food preparation galleys can feed 100 people at a time. Air Force One also has quarters for those who accompany the President, including senior advisors, Secret Service officers, traveling press, and other guests. Several cargo planes typically fly ahead of Air Force One to provide the President with services needed in remote locations. Air Force One is maintained and operated by the Presidential Airlift Group, part of the White House Military Office. The Airlift Group was founded in 1944 as the Presidential Pilot Office at the direction of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. For the next 15 years, various propeller-driven aircraft served the President, until President Dwight D. Eisenhower flew to Europe aboard VC-137A, a Boeing 707 Stratoliner, in August 1959. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy became the first President to fly in a jet specifically built for presidential use – a modified Boeing 707. Over the years, several other jet aircraft have been used, with the first of the current aircraft being delivered in 1990 during the administration of President George H. W. Bush.   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

His Presidency was impactful, but cut short after 200 days when he was assassinated. As the last of the log cabin Presidents, James A. Garfield attacked political corruption and won back for the Presidency a measure of prestige it had lost during the Reconstruction period. He was born in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, in 1831. Fatherless at two, he later drove canal boat teams, somehow earning enough money for an education. He was graduated from Williams College in Massachusetts in 1856, and he returned to the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later Hiram College) in Ohio as a classics professor. Within a year he was made its president. Garfield was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1859 as a Republican. During the secession crisis, he advocated coercing the seceding states back into the Union. In 1862, when Union military victories had been few, he successfully led a brigade at Middle Creek, Kentucky, against Confederate troops. At 31, Garfield became a brigadier general, two years later a major general of volunteers. Meanwhile, in 1862, Ohioans elected him to Congress. President Lincoln persuaded him to resign his commission: It was easier to find major generals than to obtain effective Republicans for Congress. Garfield repeatedly won re-election for 18 years, and became the leading Republican in the House. At the 1880 Republican Convention, Garfield failed to win the Presidential nomination for his friend John Sherman. Finally, on the 36th ballot, Garfield himself became the ""dark horse"" nominee. By a margin of only 10,000 popular votes, Garfield defeated the Democratic nominee, Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock. As President, Garfield strengthened Federal authority over the New York Customs House, stronghold of Senator Roscoe Conkling, who was leader of the Stalwart Republicans and dispenser of patronage in New York. When Garfield submitted to the Senate a list of appointments including many of Conkling's friends, he named Conkling's arch-rival William H. Robertson to run the Customs House. Conkling contested the nomination, tried to persuade the Senate to block it, and appealed to the Republican caucus to compel its withdrawal. But Garfield would not submit: ""This...will settle the question whether the President is registering clerk of the Senate or the Executive of the United States.... shall the principal port of entry ... be under the control of the administration or under the local control of a factional senator."" Conkling maneuvered to have the Senate confirm Garfield's uncontested nominations and adjourn without acting on Robertson. Garfield countered by withdrawing all nominations except Robertson's; the Senators would have to confirm him or sacrifice all the appointments of Conkling's friends. In a final desperate move, Conkling and his fellow-Senator from New York resigned, confident that their legislature would vindicate their stand and re-elect them. Instead, the legislature elected two other men; the Senate confirmed Robertson. Garfield's victory was complete. In foreign affairs, Garfield's Secretary of State invited all American republics to a conference to meet in Washington in 1882. But the conference never took place. On July 2, 1881, in a Washington railroad station, an embittered attorney who had sought a consular post shot the President. Mortally wounded, Garfield lay in the White House for weeks. Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, tried unsuccessfully to find the bullet with an induction-balance electrical device which he had designed. On September 6, Garfield was taken to the New Jersey seaside. For a few days he seemed to be recuperating, but on September 19, 1881, he died from an infection and internal hemorrhage.

W. Bush George H. W. Bush, as the 41st President (1989-1993), brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States ""a kinder and gentler nation"" in the face of a dramatically changing world. George Bush brought to the White House a dedication to traditional American values and a determination to direct them toward making the United States ""a kinder and gentler nation."" In his Inaugural Address he pledged in ""a moment rich with promise"" to use American strength as ""a force for good."" Coming from a family with a tradition of public service, George Herbert Walker Bush felt the responsibility to make his contribution both in time of war and in peace. Born in Milton, Massachusetts, on June 12, 1924, he became a student leader at Phillips Academy in Andover. On his 18th birthday he enlisted in the armed forces. The youngest pilot in the Navy when he received his wings, he flew 58 combat missions during World War II. On one mission over the Pacific as a torpedo bomber pilot he was shot down by Japanese antiaircraft fire and was rescued from the water by a U. S. submarine. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in action. Bush next turned his energies toward completing his education and raising a family. In January 1945 he married Barbara Pierce. They had six children-- George, Robin (who died as a child), John (known as Jeb), Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy. At Yale University he excelled both in sports and in his studies; he was captain of the baseball team and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation Bush embarked on a career in the oil industry of West Texas. Like his father, Prescott Bush, who was elected a Senator from Connecticut in 1952, George became interested in public service and politics. He served two terms as a Representative to Congress from Texas. Twice he ran unsuccessfully for the Senate. Then he was appointed to a series of high-level positions: Ambassador to the United Nations, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Chief of the U. S. Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In 1980 Bush campaigned for the Republican nomination for President. He lost, but was chosen as a running mate by Ronald Reagan. As Vice President, Bush had responsibility in several domestic areas, including Federal deregulation and anti-drug programs, and visited scores of foreign countries. In 1988 Bush won the Republican nomination for President and, with Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate, he defeated Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in the general election. Bush faced a dramatically changing world, as the Cold War ended after 40 bitter years, the Communist empire broke up, and the Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union ceased to exist; and reformist President Mikhail Gorbachev, whom Bush had supported, resigned. While Bush hailed the march of democracy, he insisted on restraint in U. S. policy toward the group of new nations. In other areas of foreign policy, President Bush sent American troops into Panama to overthrow the corrupt regime of General Manuel Noriega, who was threatening the security of the canal and the Americans living there. Noriega was brought to the United States for trial as a drug trafficker. Bush's greatest test came when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, then threatened to move into Saudi Arabia. Vowing to free Kuwait, Bush rallied the United Nations, the U. S. people, and Congress and sent 425,000 American troops. They were joined by 118,000 troops from allied nations. After weeks of air and missile bombardment, the 100-hour land battle dubbed Desert Storm routed Iraq's million-man army. Despite unprecedented popularity from this military and diplomatic triumph, Bush was unable to withstand discontent at home from a faltering economy, rising violence in inner cities, and continued high deficit spending. In 1992 he lost his bid for reelection to Democrat William Clinton.

Trump signed legislation (House Joint Resolution 38) to stop the costly “Stream Protection Rule” from further harming coal workers and the communities that depend on them. H.J. Res. 38 blocks an overly burdensome regulation from harming the coal industry. The regulation was expected to reduce coal production, leading to fewer coal jobs across the country. The blocked regulation threatened the coal industry with millions of dollars in compliance costs. Complying with the regulation would have put an unsustainable financial burden on small mines, most of which are in the Appalachian Basin. The blocked regulation would have duplicated existing regulations already in place to protect Americans. GIVING COAL COUNTRY RELIEF: Since 2009, the coal industry has declined, leaving workers and communities without a lifeline. Since January 2009, the coal mining industry has lost over 36,000 jobs without any relief in sight. From 2009 to 2015, coal production declined by over 177,000,000 tons across the country. From 2009 to 2015, over 600 coal mines closed. A PROMISE TO COAL WORKERS: Before President Trump’s inauguration, he promised coal workers he would support them and reverse the harmful actions of the past administration. November 21, 2016, the Trump-Pence Transition Team pledged to “end the war on coal” and review harmful regulations created under the Obama Administration. September 22, 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump called out harmful coal regulations: “I will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.” August 8, 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump pledged to the American people: “We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.” GETTING GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY: President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on all Americans, their pocketbooks, and their businesses. President Trump has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated. President Trump has placed a moratorium on all new regulations by executive departments and agencies that are not compelled by Congress or public safety. President Trump directed the Commerce Department to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing and to reduce regulatory burdens on domestic manufacturers. President Trump signed an Executive Order expediting the environmental review and approval processes for domestic infrastructure projects. President Trump signed legislation to eliminate a costly regulation that threatened to put domestic extraction companies and their employees at an unfair disadvantage. President Trump directed the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a full review of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to ensure associated, burdensome regulations receive proper scrutiny. President Trump ordered re-examination of the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule, to make certain that it does not harm Americans as they save for retirement.

At 2:30 on the morning of August 3, 1923, while visiting in Vermont, Calvin Coolidge received word that he was President. By the light of a kerosene lamp, his father, who was a notary public, administered the oath of office as Coolidge placed his hand on the family Bible. Coolidge was ""distinguished for character more than for heroic achievement,"" wrote a Democratic admirer, Alfred E. Smith. ""His great task was to restore the dignity and prestige of the Presidency when it had reached the lowest ebb in our history ... in a time of extravagance and waste...."" Born in Plymouth, Vermont, on July 4, 1872, Coolidge was the son of a village storekeeper. He was graduated from Amherst College with honors, and entered law and politics in Northampton, Massachusetts. Slowly, methodically, he went up the political ladder from councilman in Northampton to Governor of Massachusetts, as a Republican. En route he became thoroughly conservative. As President, Coolidge demonstrated his determination to preserve the old moral and economic precepts amid the material prosperity which many Americans were enjoying. He refused to use Federal economic power to check the growing boom or to ameliorate the depressed condition of agriculture and certain industries. His first message to Congress in December 1923 called for isolation in foreign policy, and for tax cuts, economy, and limited aid to farmers. He rapidly became popular. In 1924, as the beneficiary of what was becoming known as ""Coolidge prosperity,"" he polled more than 54 percent of the popular vote. In his Inaugural he asserted that the country had achieved ""a state of contentment seldom before seen,"" and pledged himself to maintain the status quo. In subsequent years he twice vetoed farm relief bills, and killed a plan to produce cheap Federal electric power on the Tennessee River. The political genius of President Coolidge, Walter Lippmann pointed out in 1926, was his talent for effectively doing nothing: ""This active inactivity suits the mood and certain of the needs of the country admirably. It suits all the business interests which want to be let alone.... And it suits all those who have become convinced that government in this country has become dangerously complicated and top-heavy...."" Coolidge was both the most negative and remote of Presidents, and the most accessible. He once explained to Bernard Baruch why he often sat silently through interviews: ""Well, Baruch, many times I say only 'yes' or 'no' to people. Even that is too much. It winds them up for twenty minutes more."" But no President was kinder in permitting himself to be photographed in Indian war bonnets or cowboy dress, and in greeting a variety of delegations to the White House. Both his dry Yankee wit and his frugality with words became legendary. His wife, Grace Goodhue Coolidge, recounted that a young woman sitting next to Coolidge at a dinner party confided to him she had bet she could get at least three words of conversation from him. Without looking at her he quietly retorted, ""You lose."" And in 1928, while vacationing in the Black Hills of South Dakota, he issued the most famous of his laconic statements, ""I do not choose to run for President in 1928."" By the time the disaster of the Great Depression hit the country, Coolidge was in retirement. Before his death in January 1933, he confided to an old friend, "". . . I feel I no longer fit in with these times."" The Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from “The Presidents of the United States of America,” by Frank Freidel and Hugh Sidey.

Sec. 2.  Regulatory Cap for Fiscal Year 2017.  (a)  Unless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency (agency) publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed. (b)  For fiscal year 2017, which is in progress, the heads of all agencies are directed that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero, unless otherwise required by law or consistent with advice provided in writing by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (Director). (c)  In furtherance of the requirement of subsection (a) of this section, any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations.  Any agency eliminating existing costs associated with prior regulations under this subsection shall do so in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law. (d)  The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of this section.  Such guidance shall address, among other things, processes for standardizing the measurement and estimation of regulatory costs; standards for determining what qualifies as new and offsetting regulations; standards for determining the costs of existing regulations that are considered for elimination; processes for accounting for costs in different fiscal years; methods to oversee the issuance of rules with costs offset by savings at different times or different agencies; and emergencies and other circumstances that might justify individual waivers of the requirements of this section.  The Director shall consider phasing in and updating these requirements. Sec. 3.  Annual Regulatory Cost Submissions to the Office of Management and Budget.  (a)  Beginning with the Regulatory Plans (required under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, as amended, or any successor order) for fiscal year 2018, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the head of each agency shall identify, for each regulation that increases incremental cost, the offsetting regulations described in section 2(c) of this order, and provide the agency's best approximation of the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation. (b)  Each regulation approved by the Director during the Presidential budget process shall be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order. (c)  Unless otherwise required by law, no regulation shall be issued by an agency if it was not included on the most recent version or update of the published Unified Regulatory Agenda as required under Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order, unless the issuance of such regulation was approved in advance in writing by the Director. (d)  During the Presidential budget process, the Director shall identify to agencies a total amount of incremental costs that will be allowed for each agency in issuing new regulations and repealing regulations for the next fiscal year.  No regulations exceeding the agency's total incremental cost allowance will be permitted in that fiscal year, unless required by law or approved in writing by the Director.  The total incremental cost allowance may allow an increase or require a reduction in total regulatory cost. (e)  The Director shall provide the heads of agencies with guidance on the implementation of the requirements in this section. Sec. 4.  Definition.  For purposes of this order the term ""regulation"" or ""rule"" means an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the procedure or practice requirements of an agency, but does not include: (a)  regulations issued with respect to a military, national security, or foreign affairs function of the United States; (b)  regulations related to agency organization, management, or personnel; or (c)  any other category of regulations exempted by the Director. Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)  the functions of the Director relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Northerners and Southerners disputed sharply whether the territories wrested from Mexico should be opened to slavery, and some Southerners even threatened secession. Standing firm, Zachary Taylor was prepared to hold the Union together by armed force rather than by compromise. Born in Virginia in 1784, he was taken as an infant to Kentucky and raised on a plantation. He was a career officer in the Army, but his talk was most often of cotton raising. His home was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and he owned a plantation in Mississippi. But Taylor did not defend slavery or southern sectionalism; 40 years in the Army made him a strong nationalist. He spent a quarter of a century policing the frontiers against Indians. In the Mexican War he won major victories at Monterrey and Buena Vista. President Polk, disturbed by General Taylor's informal habits of command and perhaps his Whiggery as well, kept him in northern Mexico and sent an expedition under Gen. Winfield Scott to capture Mexico City. Taylor, incensed, thought that ""the battle of Buena Vista opened the road to the city of Mexico and the halls of Montezuma, that others might revel in them."" ""Old Rough and Ready's"" homespun ways were political assets. His long military record would appeal to northerners; his ownership of 100 slaves would lure southern votes. He had not committed himself on troublesome issues. The Whigs nominated him to run against the Democratic candidate, Lewis Cass, who favored letting the residents of territories decide for themselves whether they wanted slavery. In protest against Taylor the slaveholder and Cass the advocate of ""squatter sovereignty,"" northerners who opposed extension of slavery into territories formed a Free Soil Party and nominated Martin Van Buren. In a close election, the Free Soilers pulled enough votes away from Cass to elect Taylor. Although Taylor had subscribed to Whig principles of legislative leadership, he was not inclined to be a puppet of Whig leaders in Congress. He acted at times as though he were above parties and politics. As disheveled as always, Taylor tried to run his administration in the same rule-of-thumb fashion with which he had fought Indians. Traditionally, people could decide whether they wanted slavery when they drew up new state constitutions. Therefore, to end the dispute over slavery in new areas, Taylor urged settlers in New Mexico and California to draft constitutions and apply for statehood, bypassing the territorial stage. Southerners were furious, since neither state constitution was likely to permit slavery; Members of Congress were dismayed, since they felt the President was usurping their policy-making prerogatives. In addition, Taylor's solution ignored several acute side issues: the northern dislike of the slave market operating in the District of Columbia; and the southern demands for a more stringent fugitive slave law. In February 1850 President Taylor had held a stormy conference with southern leaders who threatened secession. He told them that if necessary to enforce the laws, he personally would lead the Army. Persons ""taken in rebellion against the Union, he would hang ... with less reluctance than he had hanged deserters and spies in Mexico."" He never wavered. Then events took an unexpected turn. After participating in ceremonies at the Washington Monument on a blistering July 4, Taylor fell ill; within five days he was dead. After his death, the forces of compromise triumphed, but the war Taylor had been willing to face came 11 years later. In it, his only son Richard served as a general in the Confederate Army.

She served as First Lady of the United States from 1865 to 1869. ""I knew he'd be acquitted; I knew it,"" declared Eliza McCardle Johnson, told how the Senate had voted in her husband's impeachment trial. Her faith in him had never wavered during those difficult days in 1868, when her courage dictated that all White House social events should continue as usual. That faith began to develop many years before in east Tennessee, when Andrew Johnson first came to Greeneville, across the mountains from North Carolina, and established a tailor shop. Eliza was almost 16 then and Andrew only 17; and local tradition tells of the day she first saw him. He was driving a blind pony hitched to a small cart, and she said to a girl friend, ""There goes my beau!"" She married him within a year, on May 17, 1827. Eliza was the daughter of Sarah Phillips and John McCardle, a shoemaker. Fortunately she had received a good basic education that she was delighted to share with her new husband. He already knew his letters and could read a bit, so she taught him writing and arithmetic. With their limited means, her skill at keeping a house and bringing up a family--five children, in all--had much to do with Johnson's success. He rose rapidly, serving in the state and national legislatures and as governor. Like him, when the Civil War came, people of east Tennessee remained loyal to the Union; Lincoln sent him to Nashville as military governor in 1862. Rebel forces caught Eliza at home with part of the family. Only after months of uncertainty did they rejoin Andrew Johnson in Nashville. By 1865 a soldier son and son-in-law had died, and Eliza was an invalid for life. Quite aside from the tragedy of Lincoln's death, she found little pleasure in her husband's position as President. At the White House, she settled into a second-floor room that became the center of activities for a large family: her two sons, her widowed daughter Mary Stover and her children; her older daughter Martha with her husband, Senator David T. Patterson, and their children. As a schoolgirl Martha had often been the Polks' guest at the mansion; now she took up its social duties. She was a competent, unpretentious, and gracious hostess even during the impeachment crisis. At the end of Johnson's term, Eliza returned with relief to her home in Tennessee, restored from wartime vandalism. She lived to see the legislature of her state vindicate her husband's career by electing him to the Senate in 1875, and survived him by nearly six months, dying at the Pattersons' home in 1876.  The biographies of the First Ladies on WhiteHouse.gov are from “The First Ladies of the United States of America,” by Allida Black.

Res. 42 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants (Rep. Brady, R-TX, and 25 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 44 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of the Interior Relating to Bureau of Land Management Regulations that Establish the Procedures Used to Prepare, Revise, or Amend Land Use Plans Pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (Rep. Cheney, R-WY, and 16 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 57 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Accountability and State Plans Under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (Rep. Rokita, R-IN, and 12 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 58 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Teacher Preparation Issues (Rep. Guthrie, R-KY, and 12 cosponsors)   The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act establish onerous reporting requirements and other constraints on States, local communities, and institutions of higher education. H.J. Res. 42 would nullify the Employment and Training Administration's Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants 81 Fed. Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Labor. The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by States when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested. The rule imposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. H.J. Res. 44 would nullify the final rule relating to Resource Management Planning, 81 Fed. Reg. 89580 (Dec. 12, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize regional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for activities on public lands. The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located mostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy and mineral development. Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes the rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities’ interests and could potentially dilute their input in planning decisions. H.J. Res. 57 would nullify the final rule Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act – Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86076 (Nov. 29, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes requirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have an accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student success, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student progress. While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local control of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas where the ESSA intended broad flexibility. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on how the Department of Education can support States and school districts as they implement the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. H.J. Res. 58 would nullify the final rule related to the Teacher Preparation Program Accountability System, 81 Fed. Reg. 75494 (Oct. 31, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes annual State reporting to measure the performance and quality of teacher preparation programs and tie them to program eligibility for participation in the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grant program. The rule imposes new burdensome and costly data reporting requirements on States and institutions of higher education. If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law.

On April 30, 1789, George Washington, standing on the balcony of Federal Hall on Wall Street in New York, took his oath of office as the first President of the United States. ""As the first of every thing, in our situation will serve to establish a Precedent,"" he wrote James Madison, ""it is devoutly wished on my part, that these precedents may be fixed on true principles."" Born in 1732 into a Virginia planter family, he learned the morals, manners, and body of knowledge requisite for an 18th century Virginia gentleman. He pursued two intertwined interests: military arts and western expansion. At 16 he helped survey Shenandoah lands for Thomas, Lord Fairfax. Commissioned a lieutenant colonel in 1754, he fought the first skirmishes of what grew into the French and Indian War. The next year, as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock, he escaped injury although four bullets ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him. From 1759 to the outbreak of the American Revolution, Washington managed his lands around Mount Vernon and served in the Virginia House of Burgesses. Married to a widow, Martha Dandridge Custis, he devoted himself to a busy and happy life. But like his fellow planters, Washington felt himself exploited by British merchants and hampered by British regulations. As the quarrel with the mother country grew acute, he moderately but firmly voiced his resistance to the restrictions. When the Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 1775, Washington, one of the Virginia delegates, was elected Commander in Chief of the Continental Army. On July 3, 1775, at Cambridge, Massachusetts, he took command of his ill-trained troops and embarked upon a war that was to last six grueling years. He realized early that the best strategy was to harass the British. He reported to Congress, ""we should on all Occasions avoid a general Action, or put anything to the Risque, unless compelled by a necessity, into which we ought never to be drawn."" Ensuing battles saw him fall back slowly, then strike unexpectedly. Finally in 1781 with the aid of French allies--he forced the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown. Washington longed to retire to his fields at Mount Vernon. But he soon realized that the Nation under its Articles of Confederation was not functioning well, so he became a prime mover in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia in 1787. When the new Constitution was ratified, the Electoral College unanimously elected Washington President. He did not infringe upon the policy making powers that he felt the Constitution gave Congress. But the determination of foreign policy became preponderantly a Presidential concern. When the French Revolution led to a major war between France and England, Washington refused to accept entirely the recommendations of either his Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, who was pro-French, or his Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who was pro-British. Rather, he insisted upon a neutral course until the United States could grow stronger. To his disappointment, two parties were developing by the end of his first term. Wearied of politics, feeling old, he retired at the end of his second. In his Farewell Address, he urged his countrymen to forswear excessive party spirit and geographical distinctions. In foreign affairs, he warned against long-term alliances. Washington enjoyed less than three years of retirement at Mount Vernon, for he died of a throat infection December 14, 1799. For months the Nation mourned him. The Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from “The Presidents of the United States of America,” by Frank Freidel  and Hugh Sidey.

One of nine children of a Presbyterian minister, Cleveland was born in New Jersey in 1837. He was raised in upstate New York. As a lawyer in Buffalo, he became notable for his single-minded concentration upon whatever task faced him. At 44, he emerged into a political prominence that carried him to the White House in three years. Running as a reformer, he was elected Mayor of Buffalo in 1881, and later, Governor of New York. Cleveland won the Presidency with the combined support of Democrats and reform Republicans, the ""Mugwumps,"" who disliked the record of his opponent James G. Blaine of Maine. A bachelor, Cleveland was ill at ease at first with all the comforts of the White House. ""I must go to dinner,"" he wrote a friend, ""but I wish it was to eat a pickled herring a Swiss cheese and a chop at Louis' instead of the French stuff I shall find."" In June 1886 Cleveland married 21-year-old Frances Folsom; he was the only President married in the White House. Cleveland vigorously pursued a policy barring special favors to any economic group. Vetoing a bill to appropriate $10,000 to distribute seed grain among drought-stricken farmers in Texas, he wrote: ""Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the Government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character. . . . "" He also vetoed many private pension bills to Civil War veterans whose claims were fraudulent. When Congress, pressured by the Grand Army of the Republic, passed a bill granting pensions for disabilities not caused by military service, Cleveland vetoed it, too. He angered the railroads by ordering an investigation of western lands they held by Government grant. He forced them to return 81,000,000 acres. He also signed the Interstate Commerce Act, the first law attempting Federal regulation of the railroads. In December 1887 he called on Congress to reduce high protective tariffs. Told that he had given Republicans an effective issue for the campaign of 1888, he retorted, ""What is the use of being elected or re-elected unless you stand for something?"" But Cleveland was defeated in 1888; although he won a larger popular majority than the Republican candidate Benjamin Harrison, he received fewer electoral votes. Elected again in 1892, Cleveland faced an acute depression. He dealt directly with the Treasury crisis rather than with business failures, farm mortgage foreclosures, and unemployment. He obtained repeal of the mildly inflationary Sherman Silver Purchase Act and, with the aid of Wall Street, maintained the Treasury's gold reserve. When railroad strikers in Chicago violated an injunction, Cleveland sent Federal troops to enforce it. ""If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a post card in Chicago,"" he thundered, ""that card will be delivered."" Cleveland's blunt treatment of the railroad strikers stirred the pride of many Americans. So did the vigorous way in which he forced Great Britain to accept arbitration of a disputed boundary in Venezuela. But his policies during the depression were generally unpopular. His party deserted him and nominated William Jennings Bryan in 1896. After leaving the White House, Cleveland lived in retirement in Princeton, New Jersey. He died in 1908.  The Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from “The Presidents of the United States of America,” by Frank Freidel and Hugh Sidey.

Roosevelt's four terms in office (1933-1945). She was an American politician, diplomat, and activist who later served as a United Nations spokeswoman. A shy, awkward child, starved for recognition and love, Eleanor Roosevelt grew into a woman with great sensitivity to the underprivileged of all creeds, races, and nations. Her constant work to improve their lot made her one of the most loved--and for some years one of the most revered--women of her generation. She was born in New York City on October 11, 1884, daughter of lovely Anna Hall and Elliott Roosevelt, younger brother of Theodore. When her mother died in 1892, the children went to live with Grandmother Hall; her adored father died only two years later. Attending a distinguished school in England gave her, at 15, her first chance to develop self-confidence among other girls. Tall, slender, graceful of figure but apprehensive at the thought of being a wallflower, she returned for a debut that she dreaded. In her circle of friends was a distant cousin, handsome young Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They became engaged in 1903 and were married in 1905, with her uncle the President giving the bride away. Within eleven years Eleanor bore six children; one son died in infancy. ""I suppose I was fitting pretty well into the pattern of a fairly conventional, quiet, young society matron,"" she wrote later in her autobiography. In Albany, where Franklin served in the state Senate from 1910 to 1913, Eleanor started her long career as political helpmate. She gained a knowledge of Washington and its ways while he served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. When he was stricken with poliomyelitis in 1921, she tended him devotedly. She became active in the women's division of the State Democratic Committee to keep his interest in politics alive. From his successful campaign for governor in 1928 to the day of his death, she dedicated her life to his purposes. She became eyes and ears for him, a trusted and tireless reporter. When Mrs. Roosevelt came to the White House in 1933, she understood social conditions better than any of her predecessors and she transformed the role of First Lady accordingly. She never shirked official entertaining; she greeted thousands with charming friendliness. She also broke precedent to hold press conferences, travel to all parts of the country, give lectures and radio broadcasts, and express her opinions candidly in a daily syndicated newspaper column, ""My Day."" This made her a tempting target for political enemies but her integrity, her graciousness, and her sincerity of purpose endeared her personally to many--from heads of state to servicemen she visited abroad during World War II. As she had written wistfully at 14: ""...no matter how plain a woman may be if truth & loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be attracted to her...."" After the President's death in 1945 she returned to a cottage at his Hyde Park estate; she told reporters: ""the story is over."" Within a year, however, she began her service as American spokesman in the United Nations. She continued a vigorous career until her strength began to wane in 1962. She died in New York City that November, and was buried at Hyde Park beside her husband.

Dying of ill health during the Revolutionary War, she did not live to see her husband become President. When Thomas Jefferson came courting, Martha Wayles Skelton at 22 was already a widow, an heiress, and a mother whose firstborn son would die in early childhood. Family tradition says that she was accomplished and beautiful--with slender figure, hazel eyes, and auburn hair--and wooed by many. Perhaps a mutual love of music cemented the romance; Jefferson played the violin, and one of the furnishings he ordered for the home he was building at Monticello was a ""forte-piano"" for his bride. They were married on New Year's Day, 1772, at the bride's plantation home ""The Forest,"" near Williamsburg. When they finally reached Monticello in a late January snowstorm to find no fire, no food, and the servants asleep, they toasted their new home with a leftover half-bottle of wine and ""song and merriment and laughter."" That night, on their own mountaintop, the love of Thomas Jefferson and his bride seemed strong enough to endure any adversity. The birth of their daughter Martha in September increased their happiness. Within ten years the family gained five more children. Of them all, only two lived to grow up: Martha, called Patsy, and Mary, called Maria or Polly. The physical strain of frequent pregnancies weakened Martha Jefferson so gravely that her husband curtailed his political activities to stay near her. He served in Virginia's House of Delegates and as governor, but he refused an appointment by the Continental Congress as a commissioner to France. Just after New Year's Day, 1781, a British invasion forced Martha to flee the capital in Richmond with a baby girl a few weeks old--who died in April. In June the family barely escaped an enemy raid on Monticello. She bore another daughter the following May, and never regained a fair measure of strength. Jefferson wrote on May 20 that her condition was dangerous. After months of tending her devotedly, he noted in his account book for September 6, ""My dear wife died this day at 11:45 A.M."" Apparently he never brought himself to record their life together; in a memoir he referred to ten years ""in unchequered happiness."" Half a century later his daughter Martha remembered his sorrow: ""the violence of his emotion...to this day I not describe to myself."" For three weeks he had shut himself in his room, pacing back and forth until exhausted. Slowly that first anguish spent itself. In November he agreed to serve as commissioner to France, eventually taking ""Patsy"" with him in 1784 and send for ""Polly"" later. When Jefferson became President in 1801, he had been a widower for 19 years. He had become as capable of handling social affairs as political matters. Occasionally he called on Dolley Madison for assistance. And it was Patsy--now Mrs. Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr.--who appeared as the lady of the President's House in the winter of 1802-1803, when she spent seven weeks there. She was there again in 1805-1806, and gave birth to a son named for James Madison, the first child born in the White House. It was Martha Randolph with her family who shared Jefferson's retirement at Monticello until he died there in 1826.

In the thick of party conflict in 1800, Thomas Jefferson wrote in a private letter, ""I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man."" This powerful advocate of liberty was born in 1743 in Albemarle County, Virginia, inheriting from his father, a planter and surveyor, some 5,000 acres of land, and from his mother, a Randolph, high social standing. He studied at the College of William and Mary, then read law. In 1772 he married Martha Wayles Skelton, a widow, and took her to live in his partly constructed mountaintop home, Monticello. Freckled and sandy-haired, rather tall and awkward, Jefferson was eloquent as a correspondent, but he was no public speaker. In the Virginia House of Burgesses and the Continental Congress, he contributed his pen rather than his voice to the patriot cause. As the ""silent member"" of the Congress, Jefferson, at 33, drafted the Declaration of Independence. In years following he labored to make its words a reality in Virginia. Most notably, he wrote a bill establishing religious freedom, enacted in 1786. Jefferson succeeded Benjamin Franklin as minister to France in 1785. His sympathy for the French Revolution led him into conflict with Alexander Hamilton when Jefferson was Secretary of State in President Washington's Cabinet. He resigned in 1793. Sharp political conflict developed, and two separate parties, the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans, began to form. Jefferson gradually assumed leadership of the Republicans, who sympathized with the revolutionary cause in France. Attacking Federalist policies, he opposed a strong centralized Government and championed the rights of states. As a reluctant candidate for President in 1796, Jefferson came within three votes of election. Through a flaw in the Constitution, he became Vice President, although an opponent of President Adams. In 1800 the defect caused a more serious problem. Republican electors, attempting to name both a President and a Vice President from their own party, cast a tie vote between Jefferson and Aaron Burr. The House of Representatives settled the tie. Hamilton, disliking both Jefferson and Burr, nevertheless urged Jefferson's election. When Jefferson assumed the Presidency, the crisis in France had passed. He slashed Army and Navy expenditures, cut the budget, eliminated the tax on whiskey so unpopular in the West, yet reduced the national debt by a third. He also sent a naval squadron to fight the Barbary pirates, who were harassing American commerce in the Mediterranean. Further, although the Constitution made no provision for the acquisition of new land, Jefferson suppressed his qualms over constitutionality when he had the opportunity to acquire the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon in 1803. During Jefferson's second term, he was increasingly preoccupied with keeping the Nation from involvement in the Napoleonic wars, though both England and France interfered with the neutral rights of American merchantmen. Jefferson's attempted solution, an embargo upon American shipping, worked badly and was unpopular. Jefferson retired to Monticello to ponder such projects as his grand designs for the University of Virginia. A French nobleman observed that he had placed his house and his mind ""on an elevated situation, from which he might contemplate the universe."" He died on July 4, 1826.

Originally under the Constitution, only white male citizens over the age of 21 were eligible to vote. This shameful injustice has been corrected and voting rights have been extended several times over the course of our history. Today, citizens over the age of 18 cannot be denied the right to vote, regardless of race, religion, sex, disability, or sexual orientation. However, in every state except North Dakota, citizens must register to vote, and laws regarding the registration process vary by state. The path to full voting rights for all American citizens was long and often challenging. The franchise was first extended to African Americans under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution, passed during the Reconstruction period after the Civil War. These guaranteed that all male citizens, regardless of their race, would receive equal treatment under the law and not be deprived of their rights without due process. The Fifteenth Amendment is specifically dedicated to protecting the right of all citizens to vote, regardless of their race. For practical purposes, this was not the end of the voting rights struggle for African Americans. Because of widespread discrimination in some states, including the use of poll taxes, grandfather clauses, and literacy tests, African Americans were not assured full voting rights until President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Women were denied the right to vote until 1920, when the Nineteenth Amendment was passed. Prior to that, women had only been able to vote in select states. Federal elections occur every two years, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Every member of the House of Representatives and about one-third of the Senate is up for reelection in any given election year. A presidential election is held every fourth year. Federal elections are administered by state and local governments, although the specifics of how elections are conducted differ between the states. The Constitution and laws of the United States grant the states wide latitude in how they administer elections.   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

EST MS. SANDERS:  I'll read a little bit, give you guys a quick update.  Clearly, I'm not Sean, but hopefully you guys will treat me just as nicely as you do him every week.   First, I'd like to say the President was pleased to see that the EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, was confirmed by the Senate today.  Administrator Pruitt will be essential in the President's plan to restore the EPA's essential mission of keeping our air and water clean and safe.  In this administration, the EPA will no longer spend unnecessary taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control, anti-energy agenda.  The President is glad to finally have him officially onboard.   As you know, we just came from Boeing, where the President talked jobs with company executives and celebrated the rollout of the amazing 787-10 Dreamliner.  That airplane is an incredible example of what American ingenuity and initiative can create.  President Trump is committed to unleashing U.S. businesses so that we can create, imagine, inventive -- and building in this country again. Under the President's ambitious jobs plan, American industry will come roaring back.  He's already started ending job-killing regulations and will be working to lower taxes on American businesses, and the results are already on their way.  From Intel's incredible announcement last week to automakers keeping and bringing back thousands of jobs, businesses across the country are responding to the President's pro-growth plans. The trip to Boeing is the perfect cap on a week of tremendous progress on the President's economic agenda.  And just yesterday, he signed House Joint Resolution 38, nullifying the job-killing stream-protection rule, which went into effect on the very last day of the Obama administration.  This rule was just the left again imposing an anti-American energy agenda on the people without considering the significant cost.  It took power away from state and local governments in order to grow the federal bureaucracy, ignoring the extremely negative impact it would have on hardworking Americans and their families, and the support by putting upward pressure on energy costs.   President Trump is committed to ending the previous administration's war on coal, which is really a war on our coal miners.  An October, 2015 economic analysis by the National Mining Association found that this rule jeopardizes as many as 280,000 jobs.  Rolling back this rule is a significant step towards fulfilling the President's promise to restore America's coal-mining industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports.  The President is bringing back jobs at both the plant and mine level, and the spirit of optimism rising across this country is only going to grow as the President signs more and more bills just like this one.   Just look at the stock market, which hit record numbers this week, due to a surge in optimism in the business world and spurred by anticipation of the President's impending pro-growth agenda.  These sentiments were echoed during the President's meeting on Wednesday with a group of CEOs from some of America's largest retailers.  The retail sector supports roughly 42 million jobs, according to the National Retail Federal, more than any other sector of the economy.  It's also saddled with some of the most burdensome tax and regulations of any industry.  President Trump's pro-growth tax and regulatory reform plans will simplify our tax code and lower rates for hardworking Americans and their companies. Retail leaders thank the President for hosting them at the White House and noted that they were optimistic about the future, because no previous President had ever been so willing to hear from them directly on the issues that impact their business and customers.  The President pledged to take appropriate action in the executive branch to address their concerns and to work closely with congressional leaders to pass legislation that will help create a dynamic, booming economy that works for all Americans. Tomorrow, the President will be back in front of the people at a rally at the Orlando Melbourne International Airport. Q    Where is it -- the international airport? MS. SANDERS:  President Trump, just as he did so effectively throughout the campaign, is going to continue taking his message directly to the American people.  I know he’s looking forward to being back in Florida, a state that holds a special place in his heart, where the winter White House is, as well as a place that was so instrumental in his historic electoral victory in November.   And with that, I’ll take a few of your questions. Q    Sarah, can you talk about the expectations this weekend, in terms of who he’s going to meet with to fulfill the role of the national security advisor? MS. SANDERS:  We don’t have any announcements at this time, but I know that obviously that’s something the President takes very seriously, and wants to make sure he’s got the right person in the job. Q    Who is he considering? MS. SANDERS:  Again, we don’t have any announcements or specific details to release at this time. Q    Can you give us a sense of his timetable?  We know he had hoped to try to fill this position by today.  That’s obvious it’s not going to happen, but do -- is the expectation within the next two days? MS. SANDERS:  I don't know if we have a specific timetable, but if we do, I’ll get back to you on it. Q    Are you thinking about redefining the job or changing the job description to make it more appealing, or to make sure that people that it’s offered to will take it? MS. SANDERS:  Not to my knowledge, but, again, I can check on that. Q    While the President was at Boeing, did he express his commitment to funding the Ex-Im Bank? MS. SANDERS:  I don’t know if that was specifically addressed.  Are you talking about in the private meeting? Q    Yeah. MS. SANDERS:  Yeah, I’m not sure if that was specifically addressed.  I wasn’t in the room for the private meeting. Q    Generally, does he support funding the Ex-Im Bank? MS. SANDERS:  You know, I think that’s a question that I’ll let him answer down the line. Q    Sarah, the President yesterday said that he was going to be reintroducing the executive order -- a different version of the executive order on immigration and refugees.  What is the White House doing differently this time around to ensure that the new order could withstand any legal challenge? MS. SANDERS:  The President was pretty specific yesterday when he talked about it in terms of that it would match and address the concerns that were part of the legal complications it ran into previously. Q    Are different people involved?  Is there a different sign-off process -- anything like that? MS. SANDERS:  No, I mean, again, all of the people that needed to know the last time, that would be part of this process, would be involved in this process again. Q    Has the President seen a complete order at this point? MS. SANDERS:   I don't know if an order is finalized, but I know they’re working on it and expect to have that at the first part of next week. Q    Has he looked at it in progress, or will he wait until it’s finalized in its proposed form to take a look at it? MS. SANDERS:  I know the President has been involved in the process, but I don't know if he has seen the most up-to-date version. Q    Sarah, can you say if the administration has ever considered having the National Guard help round up undocumented immigrants? MS. SANDERS:  The President and the White House have never had that as part of any plan to use the National Guard in any capacity for that. Q    Why did Kelly draft this memo? MS. SANDERS:  I’m sorry? Q    Why did Kelly draft this memo if that was never considered? MS. SANDERS:  Secretary Kelly?   Q    Yeah. MS. SANDERS:  Secretary Kelly did not draft that memo. Q    We’re now on day 28 -- Q    Who drafted it then?  Wait, who drafted it? MS. SANDERS:  I’m not aware of the specific person, but I know that it wasn’t Secretary Kelly, or at his direction. Q    We’re now -- you know, the President was inaugurated four weeks ago today.  Why does he feel the need tomorrow to go back onto the stump?  And what should we expect to hear from him tomorrow? MS. SANDERS:  I think it’s real simple the reason he wants to go back.  I think, in large part, it’s because his message, when filtered through -- unfortunately, people standing in this circle don’t always do the best job delivering his message, and nobody does it better than he does.  And so, he can do that very easily by taking the stage and talking directly to the people of America, addressing their concerns, and being able to properly express exactly what he’s doing, what his administration has done over the last month, and what they plan to do in the coming weeks. Q    Is this a campaign rally for 2020?  Or is it a campaign rally for another candidate?  Or how do you portray it?  MS. SANDERS:  I think it’s most likely a campaign rally for America.  I think it’s -- again, it’s the President’s time to be able to speak directly to people across this country in an unfiltered way, and in a way that doesn't have any bias that's been expressed through the reporting that usually happens. Q    But it’s being funded by a political organization, not the White House, is that right?  MS. SANDERS:  Correct.  Q    Can you explain the funding? Q    Who is paying for the plane tomorrow going to and from the rally?  How that's being done? MS. SANDERS:  Specifically on the plane I’ll have to double-check.  I know the rally itself and I guess staging and everything to do with the rally is covered by the campaign.  But I’m not sure about the plane specifically.  So I’d have to -- Q    So just to clarify, when you say the campaign, this is the campaign for what? MS. SANDERS:  Well, President Trump still has a campaign in existence that can help pay for things that aren’t specific to the White House.   Q    -- the Donald J. Trump for President, correct?   MS. SANDERS:  Yes, that's still fully operational. Q    So that's a 2020 committee, not a 2016 committee?  Because that committee is now defunct. MS. SANDERS:  I’m not sure if it’s officially been transferred over from a 2016 to a 2020 focus.  But we can check on that and let you know. Q    With increasing enforcement, that we've see in this administration, if you are not looking into having 100,000 National Guard, I’m curious if you think you have to change the immigration infrastructure at all.  Add more judges or -- you've already said you want to add more agents, but with increased enforcement, are you happy with what you have nationally and infrastructure-wise? MS. SANDERS:  That's probably a question that those departments -- ICE might be better able to answer whether or not they need additional support.  But right now we're just glad that they have the opportunity to actually go out and do their job, something they haven’t probably been allowed to do over the past eight years. Q    The President saying that he loves the DACA kids, and a couple have already been swept up in this increased enforcement, will there be anything in terms of -- besides that the President has talked about keeping DACA going or not, that's still up for debate -- will you do anything for the DACA kids who are not swept up in increased enforcement? MS. SANDERS:  Look, I think the President addressed that yesterday.  He wants to make sure that that's done correctly.  Obviously, there’s a compassion piece in that.  And he’s looking at those options and seeing what the best path is on that. Q    Sarah, just to be clear, you don't know who authored the executive order? MS. SANDERS:  I don't specifically know who put pen to paper, but I know that it was not Secretary Kelly and it wasn’t at his direction. Q    Did it happen during the transition? MS. SANDERS:  I’m not aware on the exact timeline of when it happened.  But what I do know is that this White House and this President is not and has had no plans in any capacity to use the National Guard to round up people.  Thanks, guys.

A Trump Administration will empower our law enforcement officers to do their jobs and keep our streets free of crime and violence. The Trump Administration will be a law and order administration. President Trump will honor our men and women in uniform and will support their mission of protecting the public. The dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America is wrong. The Trump Administration will end it. The Trump Administration is committed to reducing violent crime. In 2015, homicides increased by 17% in America’s fifty largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings rose by 50 percent over the past four years There were thousands of shootings in Chicago last year alone. Our country needs more law enforcement, more community engagement, and more effective policing. Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, or the violent disrupter. Our job is to make life more comfortable for parents who want their kids to be able to walk the streets safely. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school. Supporting law enforcement means supporting our citizens’ ability to protect themselves. We will uphold Americans’ Second Amendment rights at every level of our judicial system. President Trump is committed to building a border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. He is dedicated to enforcing our border laws, ending sanctuary cities, and stemming the tide of lawlessness associated with illegal immigration. Supporting law enforcement also means deporting illegal aliens with violent criminal records who have remained within our borders. It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and President Donald Trump will fight for the safety of every American, and especially those Americans who have not known safe neighborhoods for a very long time.

He remains the only President to be elected from Pennsylvania and to remain a lifelong bachelor. Tall, stately, stiffly formal in the high stock he wore around his jowls, James Buchanan was the only President who never married. Presiding over a rapidly dividing Nation, Buchanan grasped inadequately the political realities of the time. Relying on constitutional doctrines to close the widening rift over slavery, he failed to understand that the North would not accept constitutional arguments which favored the South. Nor could he realize how sectionalism had realigned political parties: the Democrats split; the Whigs were destroyed, giving rise to the Republicans. Born into a well-to-do Pennsylvania family in 1791, Buchanan, a graduate of Dickinson College, was gifted as a debater and learned in the law. He was elected five times to the House of Representatives; then, after an interlude as Minister to Russia, served for a decade in the Senate. He became Polk's Secretary of State and Pierce's Minister to Great Britain. Service abroad helped to bring him the Democratic nomination in 1856 because it had exempted him from involvement in bitter domestic controversies. As President-elect, Buchanan thought the crisis would disappear if he maintained a sectional balance in his appointments and could persuade the people to accept constitutional law as the Supreme Court interpreted it. The Court was considering the legality of restricting slavery in the territories, and two justices hinted to Buchanan what the decision would be. Thus, in his Inaugural the President referred to the territorial question as ""happily, a matter of but little practical importance"" since the Supreme Court was about to settle it ""speedily and finally."" Two days later Chief Justice Roger B. Taney delivered the Dred Scott decision, asserting that Congress had no constitutional power to deprive persons of their property rights in slaves in the territories. Southerners were delighted, but the decision created a furor in the North. Buchanan decided to end the troubles in Kansas by urging the admission of the territory as a slave state. Although he directed his Presidential authority to this goal, he further angered the Republicans and alienated members of his own party. Kansas remained a territory. When Republicans won a plurality in the House in 1858, every significant bill they passed fell before southern votes in the Senate or a Presidential veto. The Federal Government reached a stalemate. Sectional strife rose to such a pitch in 1860 that the Democratic Party split into northern and southern wings, each nominating its own candidate for the Presidency. Consequently, when the Republicans nominated Abraham Lincoln, it was a foregone conclusion that he would be elected even though his name appeared on no southern ballot. Rather than accept a Republican administration, the southern ""fire-eaters"" advocated secession. President Buchanan, dismayed and hesitant, denied the legal right of states to secede but held that the Federal Government legally could not prevent them. He hoped for compromise, but secessionist leaders did not want compromise. Then Buchanan took a more militant tack. As several Cabinet members resigned, he appointed northerners, and sent the Star of the West to carry reinforcements to Fort Sumter. On January 9, 1861, the vessel was far away. Buchanan reverted to a policy of inactivity that continued until he left office. In March 1861 he retired to his Pennsylvania home Wheatland--where he died seven years later--leaving his successor to resolve the frightful issue facing the Nation.

President Ronald Reagan signs legislation to create a federal holiday honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. in the Rose Garden of the White House on November 2, 1983. (by National Archives) Only three people have a national holiday observed in their honor: Christopher Columbus, George Washington, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, celebrated on the third Monday of January each year, marks the birthday of the civil rights leader and nonviolent activist. The call for a national holiday to honor Dr. King’s legacy began soon after his assassination in 1968—U.S. Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) introduced legislation to establish the holiday just four days after Dr. King was killed, but Congress took no action on the bill. In the years that followed, millions of people signed petitions in support of the holiday. Coretta Scott King testified before Congress multiple times, calling for a federally recognized day to honor the life and work of her late husband. In 1980, Stevie Wonder released a song, “Happy Birthday,” which became both a hit and a rallying cry for supporters of the holiday, and civil rights marches in Washington in 1982 and 1983 only served to amplify their mission. A bill to establish the holiday successfully passed through both houses of Congress in 1983, and President Reagan signed it into law on November 20 of that year. The first Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was celebrated in 1986. Many Americans now honor Dr. King’s legacy by participating in a community service event in their own neighborhood andhis vision of service and volunteering is more critical than ever during this economic recovery. President Obama has called on the nation to participate in a service event in their own community this Monday, January 16, 2012. The First and Second Families, numerous members of the President’s cabinet, and thousands of other Americans across the country have committed to serve, and you can, too.

Truman and First Lady of the United States from 1945 to 1953. She served as her husband's secretary and was known for often voicing her opinions. Whistle-stopping in 1948, President Harry Truman often ended his campaign talk by introducing his wife as ""the Boss"" and his daughter, Margaret, as ""the Boss's Boss,"" and they smiled and waved as the train picked up steam. The sight of that close-knit family gallantly fighting against such long odds had much to do with his surprise victory at the polls that November. Strong family ties in the southern tradition had always been important around Independence, Missouri, where a baby girl was born to Margaret (""Madge"") Gates and David Wallace on February 13, 1885. Christened Elizabeth Virginia, she grew up as ""Bess."" Harry Truman, whose family moved to town in 1890, always kept his first impression of her -- ""golden curls"" and ""the most beautiful blue eyes."" A relative said, ""there never was but one girl in the world"" for him. They attended the same schools from fifth grade through high school. In recent years their daughter has written a vivid sketch of Bess as a girl: ""a marvelous athlete--the best third baseman in Independence, a superb tennis player, a tireless ice skater--and she was pretty besides."" She also had many ""strong opinions....and no hesitation about stating them Missouri style--straight from the shoulder."" For Bess and Harry, World War I altered a deliberate courtship. He proposed and they became engaged before Lieutenant Truman left for the battlefields of France in 1918. They were married in June 1919; they lived in Mrs. Wallace's home, where Mary Margaret was born in 1924. When Harry Truman became active in politics, Mrs. Truman traveled with him and shared his platform appearances as the public had come to expect a candidate's wife to do. His election to the Senate in 1934 took the family to Washington. Reluctant to be a public figure herself, she always shared his thoughts and interests in private. When she joined his office staff as a secretary, he said, she earned ""every cent I pay her."" His wartime role as chairman of a special committee on defense spending earned him national recognition--and a place on the Democratic ticket as President Roosevelt's fourth-term running mate. Three months after their inauguration Roosevelt was dead. On April 12, 1945, Harry Truman took the President's oath of office--and Bess, who managed to look on with composure, was the new First Lady. In the White House, its lack of privacy was distasteful to her. As her husband put it later, she was ""not especially interested"" in the ""formalities and pomp or the artificiality which, as we had learned..., inevitably surround the family of the President."" Though she conscientiously fulfilled the social obligations of her position, she did only what was necessary. While the mansion was rebuilt during the second term, the Trumans lived in Blair House and kept social life to a minimum. They returned to Independence in 1953. After her husband's death in 1972, Mrs. Truman continued to live in the family home. There she enjoyed visits from Margaret and her husband, Clifton Daniel, and their four sons. She died in 1982 and was buried beside her husband in the courtyard of the Harry S. Truman Library. You can learn more about Mrs. Truman at the Harry S. Truman Library & Museum.

He brought new excitement and power to the office, vigorously leading Congress and the American public toward progressive reforms and a strong foreign policy. With the assassination of President McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, not quite 43, became the youngest President in the Nation's history. He brought new excitement and power to the Presidency, as he vigorously led Congress and the American public toward progressive reforms and a strong foreign policy. He took the view that the President as a ""steward of the people"" should take whatever action necessary for the public good unless expressly forbidden by law or the Constitution."" I did not usurp power,"" he wrote, ""but I did greatly broaden the use of executive power."" Roosevelt's youth differed sharply from that of the log cabin Presidents. He was born in New York City in 1858 into a wealthy family, but he too struggled--against ill health--and in his triumph became an advocate of the strenuous life. In 1884 his first wife, Alice Lee Roosevelt, and his mother died on the same day. Roosevelt spent much of the next two years on his ranch in the Badlands of Dakota Territory. There he mastered his sorrow as he lived in the saddle, driving cattle, hunting big game--he even captured an outlaw. On a visit to London, he married Edith Carow in December 1886. During the Spanish-American War, Roosevelt was lieutenant colonel of the Rough Rider Regiment, which he led on a charge at the battle of San Juan. He was one of the most conspicuous heroes of the war. Boss Tom Platt, needing a hero to draw attention away from scandals in New York State, accepted Roosevelt as the Republican candidate for Governor in 1898. Roosevelt won and served with distinction. As President, Roosevelt held the ideal that the Government should be the great arbiter of the conflicting economic forces in the Nation, especially between capital and labor, guaranteeing justice to each and dispensing favors to none. Roosevelt emerged spectacularly as a ""trust buster"" by forcing the dissolution of a great railroad combination in the Northwest. Other antitrust suits under the Sherman Act followed. Roosevelt steered the United States more actively into world politics. He liked to quote a favorite proverb, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick. . . . "" Aware of the strategic need for a shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific, Roosevelt ensured the construction of the Panama Canal. His corollary to the Monroe Doctrine prevented the establishment of foreign bases in the Caribbean and arrogated the sole right of intervention in Latin America to the United States. He won the Nobel Peace Prize for mediating the Russo-Japanese War, reached a Gentleman's Agreement on immigration with Japan, and sent the Great White Fleet on a goodwill tour of the world. Some of Theodore Roosevelt's most effective achievements were in conservation. He added enormously to the national forests in the West, reserved lands for public use, and fostered great irrigation projects. He crusaded endlessly on matters big and small, exciting audiences with his high-pitched voice, jutting jaw, and pounding fist. ""The life of strenuous endeavor"" was a must for those around him, as he romped with his five younger children and led ambassadors on hikes through Rock Creek Park in Washington, D.C. Leaving the Presidency in 1909, Roosevelt went on an African safari, then jumped back into politics. In 1912 he ran for President on a Progressive ticket. To reporters he once remarked that he felt as fit as a bull moose, the name of his new party. While campaigning in Milwaukee, he was shot in the chest by a fanatic. Roosevelt soon recovered, but his words at that time would have been applicable at the time of his death in 1919: ""No man has had a happier life than I have led; a happier life in every way.""

After a policy of neutrality at the outbreak of World War I, Wilson led America into war in order to ""make the world safe for democracy."" Like Roosevelt before him, Woodrow Wilson regarded himself as the personal representative of the people. ""No one but the President,"" he said, ""seems to be expected ... to look out for the general interests of the country."" He developed a program of progressive reform and asserted international leadership in building a new world order. In 1917 he proclaimed American entrance into World War I a crusade to make the world ""safe for democracy."" Wilson had seen the frightfulness of war. He was born in Virginia in 1856, the son of a Presbyterian minister who during the Civil War was a pastor in Augusta, Georgia, and during Reconstruction a professor in the charred city of Columbia, South Carolina. After graduation from Princeton (then the College of New Jersey) and the University of Virginia Law School, Wilson earned his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University and entered upon an academic career. In 1885 he married Ellen Louise Axson. Wilson advanced rapidly as a conservative young professor of political science and became president of Princeton in 1902. His growing national reputation led some conservative Democrats to consider him Presidential timber. First they persuaded him to run for Governor of New Jersey in 1910. In the campaign he asserted his independence of the conservatives and of the machine that had nominated him, endorsing a progressive platform, which he pursued as governor. He was nominated for President at the 1912 Democratic Convention and campaigned on a program called the New Freedom, which stressed individualism and states' rights. In the three-way election he received only 42 percent of the popular vote but an overwhelming electoral vote. Wilson maneuvered through Congress three major pieces of legislation. The first was a lower tariff, the Underwood Act; attached to the measure was a graduated Federal income tax. The passage of the Federal Reserve Act provided the Nation with the more elastic money supply it badly needed. In 1914 antitrust legislation established a Federal Trade Commission to prohibit unfair business practices. Another burst of legislation followed in 1916. One new law prohibited child labor; another limited railroad workers to an eight-hour day. By virtue of this legislation and the slogan ""he kept us out of war,"" Wilson narrowly won re-election. But after the election Wilson concluded that America could not remain neutral in the World War. On April 2,1917, he asked Congress for a declaration of war on Germany. Massive American effort slowly tipped the balance in favor of the Allies. Wilson went before Congress in January 1918, to enunciate American war aims--the Fourteen Points, the last of which would establish ""A general association of nations...affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike."" After the Germans signed the Armistice in November 1918, Wilson went to Paris to try to build an enduring peace. He later presented to the Senate the Versailles Treaty, containing the Covenant of the League of Nations, and asked, ""Dare we reject it and break the heart of the world?"" But the election of 1918 had shifted the balance in Congress to the Republicans. By seven votes the Versailles Treaty failed in the Senate. The President, against the warnings of his doctors, had made a national tour to mobilize public sentiment for the treaty. Exhausted, he suffered a stroke and nearly died. Tenderly nursed by his second wife, Edith Bolling Galt, he lived until 1924.

Every one of them who worked for Gorsuch since he became a judge in 2006 — with the exception of two now clerking at the Supreme Court — signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday heralding his independence that “will never waver.” … In their letter, the former law clerks stressed Gorsuch’s strict adherence to the Constitution and the rule of law, regardless of his opinions. “As law clerks who have worked at his side, we know that Judge Gorsuch never resolves a case by the light of his personal view of what the law should be,” they said. “Nor does he ever bend the law to reach a particular result he desires.” “He has never feared staking out a principled position ... even if he had to do so alone,” they wrote. “If confirmed, we are confident that Judge Gorsuch’s independence — grounded in the limited powers granted to the judiciary by the Constitution — will never waver.” Read USA Today’s article about the letter here.

Son of a Quaker blacksmith, Herbert Clark Hoover brought to the Presidency an unparalleled reputation for public service as an engineer, administrator, and humanitarian. Born in an Iowa village in 1874, he grew up in Oregon. He enrolled at Stanford University when it opened in 1891, graduating as a mining engineer. He married his Stanford sweetheart, Lou Henry, and they went to China, where he worked for a private corporation as China's leading engineer. In June 1900 the Boxer Rebellion caught the Hoovers in Tientsin. For almost a month the settlement was under heavy fire. While his wife worked in the hospitals, Hoover directed the building of barricades, and once risked his life rescuing Chinese children. One week before Hoover celebrated his 40th birthday in London, Germany declared war on France, and the American Consul General asked his help in getting stranded tourists home. In six weeks his committee helped 120,000 Americans return to the United States. Next Hoover turned to a far more difficult task, to feed Belgium, which had been overrun by the German army. After the United States entered the war, President Wilson appointed Hoover head of the Food Administration. He succeeded in cutting consumption of foods needed overseas and avoided rationing at home, yet kept the Allies fed. After the Armistice, Hoover, a member of the Supreme Economic Council and head of the American Relief Administration, organized shipments of food for starving millions in central Europe. He extended aid to famine-stricken Soviet Russia in 1921. When a critic inquired if he was not thus helping Bolshevism, Hoover retorted, ""Twenty million people are starving. Whatever their politics, they shall be fed!"" After capably serving as Secretary of Commerce under Presidents Harding and Coolidge, Hoover became the Republican Presidential nominee in 1928. He said then: ""We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land."" His election seemed to ensure prosperity. Yet within months the stock market crashed, and the Nation spiraled downward into depression. After the crash Hoover announced that while he would keep the Federal budget balanced, he would cut taxes and expand public works spending. In 1931 repercussions from Europe deepened the crisis, even though the President presented to Congress a program asking for creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to aid business, additional help for farmers facing mortgage foreclosures, banking reform, a loan to states for feeding the unemployed, expansion of public works, and drastic governmental economy. At the same time he reiterated his view that while people must not suffer from hunger and cold, caring for them must be primarily a local and voluntary responsibility. His opponents in Congress, who he felt were sabotaging his program for their own political gain, unfairly painted him as a callous and cruel President. Hoover became the scapegoat for the Depression and was badly defeated in 1932. In the 1930's he became a powerful critic of the New Deal, warning against tendencies toward statism. In 1947 President Truman appointed Hoover to a commission, which elected him chairman, to reorganize the Executive Departments. He was appointed chairman of a similar commission by President Eisenhower in 1953. Many economies resulted from both commissions' recommendations. Over the years, Hoover wrote many articles and books, one of which he was working on when he died at 90 in New York City on October 20, 1964.

Her iconic style and social presence boosted her husband’s popularity as President. ﻿ For half a century she was the most important woman in the social circles of America. To this day she remains one of the best known and best loved ladies of the White House--though often referred to, mistakenly, as Dorothy or Dorothea. She always called herself Dolley, and by that name the New Garden Monthly Meeting of the Society of Friends, in Piedmont, North Carolina, recorded her birth to John and Mary Coles Payne, settlers from Virginia. In 1769 John Payne took his family back to his home colony, and in 1783 he moved them to Philadelphia, city of the Quakers. Dolley grew up in the strict discipline of the Society, but nothing muted her happy personality and her warm heart. John Todd, Jr., a lawyer, exchanged marriage vows with Dolley in 1790. Just three years later he died in a yellow-fever epidemic, leaving his wife with a small son. By this time Philadelphia had become the capital city. With her charm and her laughing blue eyes, fair skin, and black curls, the young widow attracted distinguished attention. Before long Dolley was reporting to her best friend that ""the great little Madison has asked...to see me this evening."" Although Representative James Madison of Virginia was 17 years her senior, and Episcopalian in background, they were married in September 1794. The marriage, though childless, was notably happy; ""our hearts understand each other,"" she assured him. He could even be patient with Dolley's son, Payne, who mishandled his own affairs--and, eventually, mismanaged Madison's estate. Discarding the somber Quaker dress after her second marriage, Dolley chose the finest of fashions. Margaret Bayard Smith, chronicler of early Washington social life, wrote: ""She looked a Queen...It would be absolutely impossiblefor any one to behave with more perfect propriety than she did."" Blessed with a desire to please and a willingness to be pleased, Dolley made her home the center of society when Madison began, in 1801, his eight years as Jefferson's Secretary of State. She assisted at the White House when the President asked her help in receiving ladies, and presided at the first inaugural ball in Washington when her husband became Chief Executive in 1809. Dolley's social graces made her famous. Her political acumen, prized by her husband, is less renowned, though her gracious tact smoothed many a quarrel. Hostile statesmen, difficult envoys from Spain or Tunisia, warrior chiefs from the west, flustered youngsters--she always welcomed everyone. Forced to flee from the White House by a British army during the War of 1812, she returned to find the mansion in ruins. Undaunted by temporary quarters, she entertained as skillfully as ever. At their plantation Montpelier in Virginia, the Madisons lived in pleasant retirement until he died in 1836. She returned to the capital in the autumn of 1837, and friends found tactful ways to supplement her diminished income. She remained in Washington until her death in 1849, honored and loved by all. The delightful personality of this unusual woman is a cherished part of her country's history.

She was the youngest First Lady to pass away and one of only three to have passed away in the White House.  Letitia Tyler had been confined to an invalid's chair for two years when her husband unexpectedly became President. Nobody had thought of that possibility when he took his oath of office as Vice President on March 4, 1841; indeed, he had planned to fill his undemanding duties from his home in Williamsburg where his wife was most comfortable, her Bible, prayer book, and knitting at her side. Born on a Tidewater Virginia plantation in the 18th century, Letitia was spiritually akin to Martha Washington and Martha Jefferson. Formal education was no part of this pattern of life, but Letitia learned all the skills of managing a plantation, rearing a family, and presiding over a home that would be John Tyler's refuge during an active political life. They were married on March 29, 1813--his twenty-third birthday. Thereafter, whether he served in Congress or as Governor of Virginia, she attended to domestic duties. Only once did she join him for the winter social season in Washington. Of the eight children she bore, seven survived; but after 1839 she was a cripple, though ""still beautiful now in her declining years."" So her admiring new daughter-in-law, Priscilla Cooper Tyler, described her--""the most entirely unselfish person you can imagine...Notwithstanding her very delicate health, mother attends to and regulates all the household affairs and all so quietly that you can't tell when she does it."" In a second-floor room at the White House, Letitia Tyler kept her quiet but pivotal role in family activities. She did not attempt to take part in the social affairs of the administration. Her married daughters had their own homes; the others were too young for the full responsibility of official entertaining; Priscilla at age 24 assumed the position of White House hostess, met its demands with spirit and success, and enjoyed it. Daughter of a well-known tragedian, Priscilla Cooper had gone on the stage herself at 17. Playing Desdemona to her father's Othello in Richmond, she won the instant interest of Robert Tyler, whom she married in 1839. Intelligent and beautiful, with dark brown hair, she charmed the President's guests--from visiting celebrities like Charles Dickens to enthusiastic countrymen. Once she noted ruefully: ""such hearty shakes as they gave my poor little hand too!"" She enjoyed the expert advice of Dolley Madison, and the companionship of her young sister-in-law Elizabeth until she married William N. Waller in 1842. For this wedding Letitia made her only appearance at a White House social function. ""Lizzie looked surpassingly lovely,"" said Priscilla, and ""our dear mother"" was ""far more attractive to me...than any other lady in the room,"" greeting her guests ""in her sweet, gentle, self-possessed manner."" The first President's wife to die in the White House, Letitia Tyler ended her days peacefully on September 10, 1842, holding a damask rose in her hand. She was taken to Virginia for burial at the plantation of her birth, deeply mourned by her family. ""She had everything about her,"" said Priscilla, ""to awaken love...""

EST THE PRESIDENT:  It is my great honor tonight to present to the American people our new Treasury Secretary of the United States, Steven Mnuchin. Steven, I want to congratulate you.  A lot of people wanted that position, Steven.  A lot of people.  A lot of very successful people.  But I've known you for a long time, and I know how smart you are and how great you will be for our country.  So congratulations to you, to Louise, and to your whole family. Americans should know that Steven -- our nation's financial system is truly in great hands.  With him, we're going to have no problem, believe me.  Once again, with this appointment, I am following through on my promise to appoint only the very best and the very brightest.  Steven is a financial legend with an incredible track record of success.  I've watched this over the years.  He's been my friend for many, many years.  Everything he's touched has turned to gold.  He's done an amazing job.  And that's what we want for our country. He has distinguished himself through decades of achievement in finance and in banking, and has a degree of skill, talent, and insight that few will ever be able to match.  He has spent his entire career making money in the private sector, and that's okay -- especially when you're Secretary of Treasury.  That's what we want.  Now he will go to work on behalf of the American taxpayer.   To all citizens I say:  Steven will be your champion, and a great champion.  He will fight for middle-class tax reductions, financial reforms that open up lending and create millions of new jobs, and fiercely defend the American tax dollar and our financial security.  And he will also defend our manufacturing jobs from those who cheat and steal and rob us blind.  It won't be that anymore.  We won't have that anymore.  Countries and others won't be able to take advantage of us.  It's a whole new era. Steven knows the system and he will help ensure that Wall Street plays by the rules.  He will use his insights to get the best possible result, most importantly for the American worker.  They've been treated very unfairly for a long time.  Not anymore.  He will put his skills to work for America's working families, and he will help make America the greatest jobs magnet on the face of the Earth.  It will truly be for our country, for the first time in a long time, a rising tide that lifts all boats and that lifts all ships.   Steven, I want to again congratulate you and Louise on this unbelievably high honor.  This is one of the great honors.  I know you will carry your office with dedication, integrity and passion -- tremendous passion.  You have much -- very important work ahead for the American citizens, and you will have absolutely no problem.  He'll work 24 hours a day -- I know him.  He'll work 28 hours a day, if they give the extra four hours.  He will be very, very special. So I'd like to just say, so importantly, God bless you, God bless America, and congratulations.  Thank you, Steven.  (Applause.)   (The Secretary is sworn in.) SECRETARY MNUCHIN:  Mr. President, I want to thank you for this extraordinary opportunity to serve you and the country as the Secretary of Treasury.  It has been a great experience to travel around the country with you for the last year, seeing so many parts of this country and meeting hundreds of business leaders. I share your economic vision and goals, and committed to working with you to enact policies, to grow the economy, and make better economic opportunities for all Americans. I would also like to thank Vice President Pence for the honor of swearing me in and for all your support in this job.  There have been so many people that have helped me in this process, and I want to thank them all as they helped prepare me for the role of Secretary.  And I want to thank them. It's a great honor to follow in the footsteps of Alexander Hamilton and so many great Treasury Secretaries.  I look forward to working with the entire great staff of the Treasury Department.  I am committed to using the full powers of this office to create more jobs, to combat terrorist activities and financing, and to make America great again.   Thank you.  (Applause.)   END 8:49 P.M.

She is the only First Lady to have been born outside of the United States. Only First Lady born outside the United States, Louisa Catherine Adams did not come to this country until four years after she had married John Quincy Adams. Political enemies sometimes called her English. She was born in London to an English mother, Catherine Nuth Johnson, but her father was American--Joshua Johnson, of Maryland--and he served as United States consul after 1790. A career diplomat at 27, accredited to the Netherlands, John Quincy developed his interest in charming 19-year-old Louisa when they met in London in 1794. Three years later they were married, and went to Berlin in course of duty. At the Prussian court she displayed the style and grace of a diplomat's lady; the ways of a Yankee farm community seemed strange indeed in 1801 when she first reached the country of which she was a citizen. Then began years divided among the family home in Quincy, Massachusetts, their house in Boston, and a political home in Washington, D.C. When the Johnsons had settled in the capital, Louisa felt more at home there than she ever did in New England. She left her two older sons in Massachusetts for education in 1809 when she took two-year-old Charles Francis to Russia, where Adams served as Minister. Despite the glamour of the tsar's court, she had to struggle with cold winters, strange customs, limited funds, and poor health; an infant daughter born in 1811 died the next year. Peace negotiations called Adams to Ghent in 1814 and then to London. To join him, Louisa had to make a forty-day journey across war-ravaged Europe by coach in winter; roving bands of stragglers and highwaymen filled her with ""unspeakable terrors"" for her son. Happily, the next two years gave her an interlude of family life in the country of her birth. Appointment of John Quincy as Monroe's Secretary of State brought the Adamses to Washington in 1817, and Louisa's drawing room became a center for the diplomatic corps and other notables. Good music enhanced her Tuesday evenings at home, and theater parties contributed to her reputation as an outstanding hostess. But the pleasure of moving to the White House in 1825 was dimmed by the bitter politics of the election and by her own poor health. She suffered from deep depression. Though she continued her weekly ""drawing rooms,"" she preferred quiet evenings--reading, composing music and verse, playing her harp. The necessary entertainments were always elegant, however; and her cordial hospitality made the last official reception a gracious occasion although her husband had lost his bid for re-election and partisan feeling still ran high. Louisa thought she was retiring to Massachusetts permanently, but in 1831 her husband began 17 years of notable service in the House of Representatives. The Adamses could look back on a secure happiness as well as many trials when they celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary at Quincy in 1847. He was fatally stricken at the Capitol the following year; she died in Washington in 1852, and today lies buried at his side in the family church at Quincy.

She was the first First Lady to be widowed while holding the title. Anna Harrison was too ill to travel when her husband set out from Ohio in 1841 for his inauguration. It was a long trip and a difficult one even by steamboat and railroad, with February weather uncertain at best, and she at age 65 was well acquainted with the rigors of frontier journeys. As a girl of 19, bringing pretty clothes and dainty manners, she went out to Ohio with her father, Judge John Cleves Symmes, who had taken up land for settlement on the ""north bend"" of the Ohio River. She had grown up a young lady of the East, completing her education at a boarding school in New York City. A clandestine marriage on November 25, 1795, united Anna Symmes and Lt. William Henry Harrison, an experienced soldier at 22. Though the young man came from one of the best families of Virginia, Judge Symmes did not want his daughter to face the hard life of frontier forts; but eventually, seeing her happiness, he accepted her choice. Though Harrison won fame as an Indian fighter and hero of the War of 1812, he spent much of his life in a civilian career. His service in Congress as territorial delegate from Ohio gave Anna and their two children a chance to visit his family at Berkeley, their plantation on the James River. Her third child was born on that trip, at Richmond in September 1800. Harrison's appointment as governor of Indiana Territory took them even farther into the wilderness; he built a handsome house at Vincennes that blended fortress and plantation mansion. Five more children were born to Anna. Facing war in 1812, the family went to the farm at North Bend. Before peace was assured, she had borne two more children. There, at news of her husband's landslide electoral victory in 1840, home-loving Anna said simply: ""I wish that my husband's friends had left him where he is, happy and contented in retirement."" When she decided not to go to Washington with him, the President-elect asked his daughter-in-law Jane Irwin Harrison, widow of his namesake son, to accompany him and act as hostess until Anna's proposed arrival in May. Half a dozen other relatives happily went with them. On April 4, exactly one month after his inauguration, he died, so Anna never made the journey. She had already begun her packing when she learned of her loss. Accepting grief with admirable dignity, she stayed at her home in North Bend until the house burned in 1858; she lived nearby with her last surviving child, John Scott Harrison, until she died in February 1864 at the age of 88.

Rokita, R-IN, and 12 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 58 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Teacher Preparation Issues (Rep. Guthrie, R-KY, and 12 cosponsors)   The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act establish onerous reporting requirements and other constraints on States, local communities, and institutions of higher education. H.J. Res. 42 would nullify the Employment and Training Administration's Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants 81 Fed. Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Labor. The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by States when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested. The rule imposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. H.J. Res. 44 would nullify the final rule relating to Resource Management Planning, 81 Fed. Reg. 89580 (Dec. 12, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize regional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for activities on public lands. The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located mostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy and mineral development. Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes the rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities’ interests and could potentially dilute their input in planning decisions. H.J. Res. 57 would nullify the final rule Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act – Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86076 (Nov. 29, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes requirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have an accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student success, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student progress. While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local control of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas where the ESSA intended broad flexibility. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on how the Department of Education can support States and school districts as they implement the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. H.J. Res. 58 would nullify the final rule related to the Teacher Preparation Program Accountability System, 81 Fed. Reg. 75494 (Oct. 31, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes annual State reporting to measure the performance and quality of teacher preparation programs and tie them to program eligibility for participation in the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grant program. The rule imposes new burdensome and costly data reporting requirements on States and institutions of higher education. If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law.

Nominated for President on the eighth ballot at the 1888 Republican Convention, Benjamin Harrison conducted one of the first ""front-porch"" campaigns, delivering short speeches to delegations that visited him in Indianapolis. As he was only 5 feet, 6 inches tall, Democrats called him ""Little Ben""; Republicans replied that he was big enough to wear the hat of his grandfather, ""Old Tippecanoe."" Born in 1833 on a farm by the Ohio River below Cincinnati, Harrison attended Miami University in Ohio and read law in Cincinnati. He moved to Indianapolis, where he practiced law and campaigned for the Republican Party. He married Caroline Lavinia Scott in 1853. After the Civil War--he was Colonel of the 70th Volunteer Infantry--Harrison became a pillar of Indianapolis, enhancing his reputation as a brilliant lawyer. The Democrats defeated him for Governor of Indiana in 1876 by unfairly stigmatizing him as ""Kid Gloves"" Harrison. In the 1880's he served in the United States Senate, where he championed Indians. homesteaders, and Civil War veterans. In the Presidential election, Harrison received 100,000 fewer popular votes than Cleveland, but carried the Electoral College 233 to 168. Although Harrison had made no political bargains, his supporters had given innumerable pledges upon his behalf. When Boss Matt Quay of Pennsylvania heard that Harrison ascribed his narrow victory to Providence, Quay exclaimed that Harrison would never know ""how close a number of men were compelled to approach... the penitentiary to make him President."" Harrison was proud of the vigorous foreign policy which he helped shape. The first Pan American Congress met in Washington in 1889, establishing an information center which later became the Pan American Union. At the end of his administration Harrison submitted to the Senate a treaty to annex Hawaii; to his disappointment, President Cleveland later withdrew it. Substantial appropriation bills were signed by Harrison for internal improvements, naval expansion, and subsidies for steamship lines. For the first time except in war, Congress appropriated a billion dollars. When critics attacked ""the billion-dollar Congress,"" Speaker Thomas B. Reed replied, ""This is a billion-dollar country."" President Harrison also signed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act ""to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies,"" the first Federal act attempting to regulate trusts. The most perplexing domestic problem Harrison faced was the tariff issue. The high tariff rates in effect had created a surplus of money in the Treasury. Low-tariff advocates argued that the surplus was hurting business. Republican leaders in Congress successfully met the challenge. Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W. Aldrich framed a still higher tariff bill; some rates were intentionally prohibitive. Harrison tried to make the tariff more acceptable by writing in reciprocity provisions. To cope with the Treasury surplus, the tariff was removed from imported raw sugar; sugar growers within the United States were given two cents a pound bounty on their production. Long before the end of the Harrison Administration, the Treasury surplus had evaporated, and prosperity seemed about to disappear as well. Congressional elections in 1890 went stingingly against the Republicans, and party leaders decided to abandon President Harrison although he had cooperated with Congress on party legislation. Nevertheless, his party renominated him in 1892, but he was defeated by Cleveland. After he left office, Harrison returned to Indianapolis, and married the widowed Mrs. Mary Dimmick in 1896. A dignified elder statesman, he died in 1901. The Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from “The Presidents of the United States of America,” by Frank Freidel and Hugh Sidey.

She served as First Lady from 1861 until his assassination in 1865 at Ford's Theatre. As a girlhood companion remembered her, Mary Todd was vivacious and impulsive, with an interesting personality--but ""she now and then could not restrain a witty, sarcastic speech that cut deeper than she intended...."" A young lawyer summed her up in 1840: ""the very creature of excitement."" All of these attributes marked her life, bringing her both happiness and tragedy. Daughter of Eliza Parker and Robert Smith Todd, pioneer settlers of Kentucky, Mary lost her mother before the age of seven. Her father remarried; and Mary remembered her childhood as ""desolate"" although she belonged to the aristocracy of Lexington, with high-spirited social life and a sound private education. Just 5 feet 2 inches at maturity, Mary had clear blue eyes, long lashes, light-brown hair with glints of bronze, and a lovely complexion. She danced gracefully, she loved finery, and her crisp intelligence polished the wiles of a Southern coquette. Nearly 21, she went to Springfield, Illinois, to live with her sister Mrs. Ninian Edwards. Here she met Abraham Lincoln--in his own words, ""a poor nobody then."" Three years later, after a stormy courtship and broken engagement, they were married. Though opposites in background and temperament, they were united by an enduring love--by Mary's confidence in her husband's ability and his gentle consideration of her excitable ways. Their years in Springfield brought hard work, a family of boys, and reduced circumstances to the pleasure-loving girl who had never felt responsibility before. Lincoln's single term in Congress, for 1847-1849, gave Mary and the boys a winter in Washington, but scant opportunity for social life. Finally her unwavering faith in her husband won ample justification with his election as President in 1860. Though her position fulfilled her high social ambitions, Mrs. Lincoln's years in the White House mingled misery with triumph. An orgy of spending stirred resentful comment. While the Civil War dragged on, Southerners scorned her as a traitor to her birth, and citizens loyal to the Union suspected her of treason. When she entertained, critics accused her of unpatriotic extravagance. When, utterly distraught, she curtailed her entertaining after her son Willie's death in 1862, they accused her of shirking her social duties. Yet Lincoln, watching her put her guests at ease during a White House reception, could say happily: ""My wife is as handsome as when she was a girl, and I...fell in love with her; and what is more, I have never fallen out."" Her husband's assassination in 1865 shattered Mary Todd Lincoln. The next 17 years held nothing but sorrow. With her son ""Tad"" she traveled abroad in search of health, tortured by distorted ideas of her financial situation. After Tad died in 1871, she slipped into a world of illusion where poverty and murder pursued her. A misunderstood and tragic figure, she passed away in 1882 at her sister's home in Springfield--the same house from which she had walked as the bride of Abraham Lincoln, 40 years before.

Trump Nominates R. Alexander Acosta to be Secretary of Labor Today, President Donald J. Trump announced his intent to nominate R. Alexander Acosta for the position of Secretary of Labor. Mr. Acosta is currently Dean of Florida International University Law School. Mr. Acosta has had a long and distinguished career in public service. He has served in three Presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed positions, including as a member of the National Labor Relations Board.

Since 2013, Mr. Acosta has also served as Chairman of U.S. Century Bank, the largest domestically owned Hispanic community bank in Florida. “Throughout his career, Alex Acosta has been a passionate advocate for equal opportunity for all Americans,” said President Trump. “His extensive experience has tremendously impressed me and my team and makes us confident that he will lead the Department of Labor with the utmost competence and determination to support the American worker. The American worker had been forgotten and left behind. That ended when I became President on January 20. Alex is going to be a key part of achieving our goal of revitalizing the American economy, manufacturing, and labor force. I call on the Senate to swiftly confirm this highly qualified and deserving leader so that he can get straight to work for the betterment of the American people.” “I am deeply grateful and honored for the opportunity to serve my country,” Mr. Acosta said. “I thank the President and his staff for their confidence in me and I am eager to work tirelessly on behalf of the American worker.” Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

EST MR. SPICER:  Hi guys, how are you?  Hope you had a great day.  I want to start off by congratulating the five-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots.  It was a great day for football last night.  And the President looks forward to welcoming the New England Patriots to the White House later this year. As you know, during the weekend, the President spoke to four world leaders.  On Saturday, he spoke with Italian Prime Minister Gentiloni, during which they discussed strengthening cooperation around a large range of shared interests.  The President also agreed to attend the G7 meeting in May, where he looks forward to meeting with the Prime Minister on the sidelines.   Also on Saturday, the President spoke with Ukrainian President Poroshenko, addressing a variety of topics, including Ukraine’s long-running conflict with Russia.  They also discussed plans for an in-person meeting in the future. On Sunday, the President had a call with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, where he reiterated the United States’ interest in (inaudible) NATO.  The two leaders agreed to continue close coordination and cooperation to discuss the full range of security issues facing NATO and its member countries.   Following that call, the President spoke with New Zealand Prime Minister English, affirming the close relationship between the two countries and our appreciation for New Zealand’s significant contributions to international peace. You guys, as you saw this afternoon, the President had an opportunity to visit with leaders of both SOCOM and CENTCOM to get an update on the issues facing our military and the hotspots around the world, the challenges we face, and the actions that our brave men and women around the globe are taking to help keep this country safe.  The President obviously had a chance to sit down with enlisted members of our military after that, and hear from them their concerns and issues, and, most importantly, thank them for their service to our nation. Tomorrow, we have a delegation that is heading out to attend the inauguration of the Haitian President in Port-au-Prince.  The State Department's Undersecretary for Political Affairs, Tom Shannon, will lead the delegation, which includes representatives from both the State Department and the White House.   The President is also looking forward to welcoming the Prime Minister of Japan this Friday, and we’ll have further guidance on that visit this weekend. With that, I’ll take a few questions.  Steve. Q    Can you give us an example of a terrorist attack anywhere that the news media has not reported on? MR. SPICER:  We’ll provide a list later.  There’s several instances.  And the President, again, got a great update today on the fight against ISIS that’s going on throughout the region and what our military is facing throughout this globe, trying to combat ISIS.  But there’s a lot of instances that have occurred where I don’t think that they’ve gotten the coverage it's deserved, and I think that’s what the President was clearly referring to there. Steve. Q    Are you rethinking your strategy toward this executive order?  What’s your next step in pushing this ahead? MR. SPICER:  We’re not rethinking the strategy at all.  I think the court has asked both parties to present their cases.  Remember, what we’re discussing right now has nothing to do with the merits of the order.  The law is very clear on this, that the President has huge discretion to protect the safety of the American people and our nation’s institutions with respect to who can come into this country.  This is just purely on the injunction that the judge issued, and I think that we’re going to make that case tonight -- or he’s got -- both sides have put forward their rulings. But again, when you look at the case in Massachusetts -- or the judge in Massachusetts, clearly the law is on the President’s side.  The Constitution is on the President’s side.  He has broad discretion to do what’s in the nation’s best interests to protect our people.  And we feel very confident that we will prevail in this matter. Q    But you're not thinking about withdrawing the executive order or rewriting it? MR. SPICER:  No, no, no.  This law -- this executive order was done in the best interest of protecting the American people.  And I think this is something that has broad support from the American people from one coast to another, and we're going to continue to do what we have to.  And this President is committed to making sure that the country and its people are safe. Q    Sean, the President over the weekend said that he believed that jihadis were now pouring into the country.  Is there any evidence to suggest that that's true?  Is that what intelligence is telling him? MR. SPICER:  I think part of the reason he issued the order the way he did was to ensure that people didn't have an advance notice, and he protected the country and ensured that we have an idea of who's coming in and out of the country.  Q    Is anybody coming in? MR. SPICER:  I’m not going to get into specific information that the President has.  Needless to say, again, that his number-one priority is to do what he can to keep the American people safe. Q    John Yoo, who was obviously a major figure in the Bush administration, who spoke about -- was a big proponent of executive authority, today wrote in The New York Times about his concerns about the way that the new administration is taking action.  What do you say to him? MR. SPICER:  Well, again, I think if you look at Secretary Kelly’s comments from last week, this was an action that was fully coordinated through departments to make sure that everyone understood what we're going to do, to make sure it was compliant, and that it was in the best interest of keeping America safe. Mr. Yoo has obviously spent some time in the Justice Department, and I think he should understand better than anybody that we did -- we took all the necessary steps and did it in a way that protected country.  Q    You said -- just to be clear -- before you said that, you're going to follow up later with the unreported terrorist -- were they unreported or under-reported?   MR. SPICER:  Under-reported. Q    And what are the reasons?  The President said that we all know what the reasons are. MR. SPICER:  Look, I think the President’s comments were very clear at the time.  He felt as though members of the media don't always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn't necessarily get the same coverage. He’s doing what he can to protect this nation and protect our people.  And that's why I think sometimes the polls don't reflect what you see on the media.  You see a wide degree of support for the President’s policies to protect this country, to create jobs, to grow the economy, and yet a lot of those stories and successes that he’s had in a mere two and a half weeks in office aren’t exactly covered to the degree to which they should be. Q    So he thinks that these terror attacks are under-reported to make him look bad? MR. SPICER:  No, that's not what he said at all.  I think his statement was very clear on that.   Yes. Q    Do you have a plan to reinstate extreme vetting?   MR. SPICER:  What?  Q    Extreme vetting of refugees, do you have -- is there a plan to reinstate it? MR. SPICER:  Reinstate it? Q    Reinstate, yes.  After the ban has been overturned. MR. SPICER:  Once we win the case, it will go right back into action.  We're complying with the court.  Once we prevail, it will go right back into action.   And again, part of that plan was a 90-day and 100-day plan respectively with respect to refugees and then people coming in to make sure that we took the steps and developed a further plan to protect the country.  Whether we add people or go more stringently in other aspects is up to part of what is determined during that period. Q    Sean, can you elaborate a little bit on what the President said to Bill O’Reilly about the irregular voter registration list and what Vice President Pence is going to be doing on that? MR. SPICER:  I think he’s very clear that he is going to -- he has named Vice President Pence to lead a task force that will look into this.  But obviously when you see so many people that have registered in two states, that that presents a problem.  There are people that have registered in two have died and been still on the rolls.  I think we need to look into this to make sure that we're protecting the integrity of the vote; that one person's vote should count the same as the next.  And any attempt to undermine that really undermines anyone else's vote right now, and that's the problem -- is that we need to make sure that when somebody votes, that we have the highest degree of integrity of that counting. Q    Hey, Sean, when the President tweeted this morning -- ""I call my own shots"" -- was he referring to Steve Bannon's role in the White House or his TIME magazine cover?  What was he referring to? MR. SPICER:  It was nothing specific.  But I think the President -- there's been a lot of attempts to discuss how this works.  The President, from day one, back through the campaign and, frankly, his time as a successful businessman, always called the shots.  He's the decider.  He's the one who develops the policy.  He's the one who makes the decisions.  And I think that there are so many times when you see things that don't recognize that he is the guy that calls those shots.  He develops the policies, he implements the policies, he makes the key decisions. Q    Just to follow up on that, The New York Times said this morning that you're rethinking your strategy of how swiftly to roll out initiatives.  Are you going to slow things down? MR. SPICER:  I would say that that story was so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the President an apology for the way that that thing was -- there were just literally blatant factual errors.  And it's unacceptable to see that kind of reporting, or so-called reporting.  That is literally the epitome of fake news.   Q    What part of the story was the -- MR. SPICER:  I mean, you start at the top -- I don't think the President owns a bathrobe, or definitely doesn't wear one.  There was no meetings in conference -- I mean, it's just -- from top to bottom, it made up stories that just don't exist.  And I think that's unfortunate for people that look to news institutions like that for their news because it is just not an accurate portrayal of what's really happening.   Q    Was the claim about whether he was briefed on the order -- the makeup of the NSC? MR. SPICER:  What's that? Q    The story talked about how the President was disappointed that he hadn't been adequately briefed on Bannon taking --  MR. SPICER:  The President is briefed on all aspects of -- Q    So could you just address that specifically?  What was he told and who briefed him on it? MR. SPICER:  I'm not going to get into detail, but I would say that the President is clearly aware of the policies that come out of the White House with his name on it.  That is what I was getting at earlier to Steve.  The President -- when it comes to decisions and policy, it's the President who leads, the President who tells us how to implement it. Thank you guys very much.  Enjoy the landing. END 4:10 P.M.

EDT PRESIDENT CLINTON:  For three years, now, and every year he has been in the White House, President Obama has come to CGI.  He believes in what we're trying to do.  In his former life, he was a walking NGO.  (Laughter.)  He also is one of those Americans who believes climate change is real and deserves a real response. (Applause.) And he recently proposed to Congress a plan that even the Republican analysts who looked at the evidence, as opposed to the rhetoric, say will add between 1.5 and 2 percent to our GDP and help us to get out of this mess we're in and enable America to help the world again. So I'm gratified that he found the time to come here.  I appreciate the work that he's involved with at the United Nations.  I think he has a brilliant Secretary of State.  (Laughter and applause.)  And I am profoundly gratified that he is here with us today.  Ladies and gentlemen, President Obama.  (Applause.)  PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you very much.  Thank you.  (Applause.) It is wonderful to be here today.  It is wonderful to see so many do-gooders all in one room.  (Laughter.)  And our do-gooder-in-chief, Bill Clinton, thank you for not only the gracious introduction, but the extraordinary work that he has been doing each and every day.  You are tireless, and we are proud of what you've been doing.  (Applause.) I want to thank the outstanding team here at CGI:  CEO Bob Harrison, Deputy Director Ed Hughes, all the dedicated staff.  And although she is not part of CGI, she's certainly part of what makes Bill so successful -- someone who he does not get to see enough because of me -- (laughter) -- but I'm grateful that he's not bitter about it.  (Laughter.)  She's one of the best Secretaries of State that we've ever had -- Hillary Clinton.  (Applause.) Now, this is the third time that I’ve been here.  Last year, I was the warm-up act for Michelle.  (Laughter.)  I just gave a big speech at the U.N. this morning, and so I will not subject you to another one.  I wanted to stop by for two reasons.  First, I want to express my appreciation for the extraordinary work that has been done by CGI.  It’s been said that “no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come.” And as you know, when Bill Clinton sees an idea out there, there’s no stopping him.  CGI was an idea whose time had come.  And thanks to his relentless determination -- but also, I think he'd agree, thanks to, most importantly, your commitments -- you’ve created new hope and opportunity for hundreds of millions of people in nearly 200 countries.  Think about that -- hundreds of millions of people have been touched by what you've done.  That doesn’t happen very often. That’s the other thing I want to talk about.  Around the world, people are still reeling from the financial crisis that unfolded three years ago and the economic pain that followed.  And this morning at the United Nations, I talked about the concerted action that the world needs to take right now to right our economic ship. But we have to remember America is still the biggest economy in the world.  So the single most important thing we could do for the global economy is to get our own economy moving again.  When America is growing the world is more likely to grow.  And obviously that's the number-one issue on the minds of every American that I meet.  If they haven’t been out of work since the recession began, odds are they know somebody who has.  They feel as if the decks have been stacked against them.  They don't feel as if hard work and responsibility pay off anymore, and they don't see that hard work and responsibility reflected either in Washington or, all too often, on Wall Street.  They just want to know that their leaders are willing to step up and do something about it. So, as President Clinton mentioned, that’s why I put forward the American Jobs Act.  Not as a silver bullet that will solve all our problems, but it will put more people back to work.  It will put more money into the pockets of working people.  And that’s what our economy needs right now. It hires teachers, and puts them back in the classroom.  It hires construction workers, puts them out rebuilding an infrastructure that has deteriorated, and we know that that’s part of our economic success historically.  It puts our veterans back to work -- after having served overseas, then coming home and not being able to find a job, when they sacrificed immeasurably on behalf of our security?  That’s what we need right now -- we need more good teachers in front of our kids.  I was just having lunch over at the General Assembly with the President of South Korea.  And I still remember the first time I met him, in South Korea, and I asked him, “Well, what are your biggest challenges right now?”  He says, “Education -- it’s a big challenge.”  I said, “Well, I understand.  We’ve got a big challenge in the United States, as well.”  He said, “No, you have to understand, my big challenge is, the parents are too demanding.”  (Laughter.)  “They’re coming into my office, they’re saying, our children have to learn English in first grade.  So we’re having to import teachers from other countries and pay them a premium to meet the educational demands that parents are placing on us, because they know that if their children are to succeed in the 21st century economy, they’d better know some foreign languages.”  Well, think about that.  That’s what’s happening in South Korea.  Here, we’re laying off teachers in droves?  Now is the time to upgrade our roads and our bridges and our schools.  We used to have the best airports, the best roads, the best bridges, the best ports.  I’ve been asking people recently  -- I've taken a poll in New York -- how do you find LaGuardia compared to the Beijing airport?  (Laughter.)  We laugh, but that says something.  That’s not inevitable; that’s a choice that we’re making.  We talk about climate change -- something that, obviously, people here are deeply concerned about.  Talking to the CEO of Southwest Airlines, they estimate that if we put in the new generation of GPS air traffic control, we would save 15 percent in fuel costs.  “Reduce fuel consumption by 15 percent, Mr. President.”  And think about what that would do, not only to potentially lower the cost of a ticket -- maybe they could start giving out peanuts again.  (Laughter .)  But think what it would do in terms of taking those pollutants out of our air.  So we know what to do.  We know that an American should -- who puts his life on the line, her life on the line, should never have to fight for a job when they come home.  We know that.  We know what our values are.  So this jobs bill addresses the terrible toll that unemployment inflicts on people.  It helps long-term unemployed keep their skills sharp.  It says to young people who are underprivileged, we’re going to give you a chance at a summer job that helps to establish the kind of work habits that carry on for generations.  Because part of what happens in this kind of recession environment -- the disadvantage of this generation coming in and not being able to get fully employed, that lingers for a lifetime.  It affects their lifetime earnings.  That’s contrary to our values. This jobs bill cuts taxes for every working family and every small business owner in America to boost demand and to boost hiring.  And if you’re a small business owner who hires a new worker or raises workers’ wages, you get an extra tax cut. So this bill answers the urgent need to create jobs right away.  And I appreciate President Clinton’s strong support of this plan over the weekend.  And the reason that that’s important is because he knows a good jobs plan when he sees it.  He created more jobs in his tenure than just about anybody.  And I’m fighting hard to make sure that we get this bill passed through Congress.  As President Clinton said, every idea in there has been supported in the past by both parties, and everything is paid for.  There’s no reason why we shouldn’t pass it right away.  And for those of you who are concerned about the international economy and development, keep this in mind:  If the economy is not growing, if Americans aren’t getting back to work, it becomes that much harder for us to sustain the critical development assistance and the partnerships that help to undergird development strategies that you care dearly about all across the world. So this is important, again, not just to the United States; this is important to the world.  It will help determine how well we can support what you are doing in the non-for-profit sector.  I’m going to be doing everything I can, everything in my power, to get this economy moving again that requires congressional support but also those things that don't require congressional support.  Consider one of the ideas that we’re working on together.  Earlier this year, I announced a Better Buildings Initiative to rehire construction workers to make our buildings more energy-efficient.  And I asked President Clinton and my Jobs Council to challenge private companies to join us.  In June, at CGI America, we announced a commitment to upgrade 300 million square feet of space, from military housing to college campuses.  Some of these projects are breaking ground this month, putting people to work right now.  Later this year, we’ll announce more commitments that will create jobs, while saving billions for businesses on energy bills and cutting down on our pollution.  And it’s a good example of what CGI is all about:  Everybody working together -- government, business, the non-for-profit sector -- to create opportunities today, while ensuring those opportunities for the future.  We just need that kind of cooperation in Washington.  I have to say that I do envy President Clinton because when you’re out of Washington, it turns out that you’re just dealing with people who are reasonable all the time.  (Laughter and applause.)  Nobody is looking to score points.  Nobody is looking at the polls on any particular issue.  You’re just trying to solve problems.  And that’s the ethic that people are looking for in Washington. We’ve got enough challenges.  It is technically difficult to figure out how we are going to deal with climate change -- not impossible, but difficult.  There are technical challenges to making sure that we’re providing enough safe drinking water around the world, or making sure that preventable diseases are eradicated in countries that don’t yet have a public health infrastructure.  These things are all tough stuff.  But they’re solvable, if everybody’s attitude is that we’re working together, as opposed to trying to work at odds with each other.  And our future depends on fighting this downturn with everything that we’ve got right now.  And it demands that we invest in ourselves, even as we’re making commitments in investments around the world.  It demands we invest in research and technology, so the great ideas of tomorrow are born in our labs and our classrooms.  It demands we invest in faster transportation and communications networks, so that our businesses can compete.  It demands that we give every child the skills and education they need to succeed.  And I thank you for the commitment that you’ve made to recruit and train tens of thousands of new science, technology, engineering and math teachers.  Nothing could be more important. We can do all this.  We can create jobs now and invest in our future, and still tackle our long-term debt problems.  Don’t tell Bill Clinton it can’t be done.  He did it.  When he was President, he did not cut our way out of prosperity; he grew our way to prosperity.  We didn’t shortchange essential investments, or balance the budget on the backs of the middle class or the poor.  We were able to live within our means, invest in our future, and ask everyone to pay their fair share.  And what happened?  The private sector thrived.  The rich got richer.  The middle class grew.  Millions rose out of poverty.  America ran a surplus that was on track to be debt-free by next year.  We were a nation firing on all cylinders.  That’s the kind of nation that we’ve got to work to build again.  It will take time after the kind of crisis that we’ve endured.  And this is a once-in-a-generation crisis.  But we can get through it.  But our politics right now is not doing us any favors.  Nevertheless, I believe we can and we will get there, by remembering what made us great -- by building an economy where innovation is encouraged, education is a national mission, new jobs and businesses choose to take root right here in the United States.  And that’s what CGI reflects.  It reflects the American spirit, which is big and bold and generous, and doesn’t shy away from challenges, and says that we’re all in it together.  And when I think about the contributions that all of you have made, that makes me confident.  Those of us who have been most blessed by this nation, we are ready to give back.  But we’ve got to be asked.  And that’s what I’m hoping members of Congress recognize.  I don’t want a small, cramped vision of what America can be.  We want a big and generous vision of what America can be.  And the world is inspired when we have that vision. And, by the way, that vision is not a Democratic vision or a Republican idea.  These are not ideas that belong to one political party or another.  They are the things a rising nation does, and the thing that retreating nations don’t do.  And we are not a retreating nation.  So despite the many challenges we face right now, I believe America must continue to be a rising nation, with rising fortunes.  And that makes -- that means making sure that everybody is participating and everybody is getting a shot, because when all of our people do well, America does well.  And when America does well, that’s good for the rest of the world.  That’s what President Clinton has always understood.  So, Mr. President, thank you for all the opportunities that you help to create every day.  Thank you to all of you who are participating in CGI.  You are doing the Lord’s work.  And I can assure you that you will continue to have a partner in the Obama administration for what I expect to be years to come.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)

Resolution 38   Roosevelt Room  3:43 P.M. EST THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  We had an exciting news conference before.  And some people loved it.  I think nobody hated it, but it was -- I think it was very productive.  And thank you all for being there, that was very nice.  And thank you, all of the wonderful politicians, but -- right, Mitch, especially the miners that are with us, right?  So I just want to thank you.  Seriously.  (Applause.)  We appreciate it.  We appreciate it very much. And this is our second bill signing this week as we continue to work for the American people.  This is H.J. Resolution 38, and that will eliminate another terrible job-killing rule, saving many thousands of American jobs, especially in the mines, which I’ve been promising you.  The mines are a big deal.  I’ve had support from some of you folks right from the very beginning, and I won’t forget it.  I went to West Virginia and I -- we had 17,000, 18,000 people that couldn’t get into that big arena, right?  You were a few of them.  But that was some day and some night.   I want to thank Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop -- thank you, Rob -- and Representative Bill Johnson, who worked very hard on this bill.  And they really did, they worked very hard.  This was a tough one. I also want to thank the great members of Congress who have joined us today.  We have a lot of them.  In eliminating this rule, I am continuing to keep my promise to the American people to get rid of wasteful regulations that do nothing -- absolutely nothing -- but slow down the economy, hamstring companies, push jobs to other countries -- which is happening all over, although I must tell you, we’ve stopped it.  You’ve seen all the factories, all the plants that are moving back.  They’re going back to a lot of places.  So you know that, right, fellas?  They’re moving back fast.  Ford, General Motors, Fiat -- so many.  Very happy. Compliance costs for this rule would be over $50 million a year for the coal industry alone, and it’s unnecessary.  I want to also thank the incredible coal miners who are with us today.  I think we can maybe thank them the most, right, for -- political leaders.  (Applause.)  You folks have put up with a lot.  And you know, in other countries, they love their coal.  Over here, we haven’t treated it with the respect it deserves.  Even for defense, having that coal is a very important thing for us.  So I want to thank you all. This rule we’re eliminating it’s a major threat to your jobs, and we’re going to get rid of that threat immediately.  We’re going to fight for you like I promised I would in the campaign.  And you were very good to me, and I’m going to be even better to you, I promise you that. And we’re going to fight for, also, low-energy prices for all Americans.  There’s a spirit of optimism rising across the country.  It’s going to continue to grow as we sign more and more bills.  We’re going to make our nation more than competitive -- not just competitive, we’re going to be more than competitive.  And we’re going to win at many, many industries.  We’re already starting back with the automobile industry.  We had the airline industry in the other day.  They have rules and regulations that by the time they get through it, it’s -- nothing left, and they have to get rid of a lot of jobs.  We had a great meeting, actually. We had the unions in.  We had the workers in.  We had a lot of people in, and they were all very excited about what’s happening.  And I haven’t looked yet at the stock market, but it’s been going up at record clips.  We have a tremendous streak going on.  And that’s only because of the optimism.  They feel the optimism.  And that optimism is creating a lot of jobs. So it’s an honor to have everybody with us, and, in particular, the miners.  We appreciate everything you’ve done, fellas.  Thank you very much.   Would anybody like to say a few words?  How about one of the miners saying a few words?  I hear these guys all the time.  I hear Rand all the time.  (Laughter.)  Come on.  Who’d like to -- come on, Mike. MR. NELSON:  President Trump, we thank you very much for everything you’ve done for us.  Everything that you’re doing for our industry is very much needed.  I’ve been mining in this industry for 40 years, and this is a very exciting time for our industry.  Thank you very much. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much. SENATOR MANCHIN:  Tell him where you’re from, Mike. MR. NELSON:  I’m from Morgantown, West Virginia, but I work at the Marion County Coal Company. THE PRESIDENT:  How did I do in that area? MR. NELSON:  Oh, you did great.  (Laughter and applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  Good.  Say something. CONGRESSWOMAN CAPITO:  Well, President Trump -- THE PRESIDENT:  You’re a -- you represent. CONGRESSWOMAN CAPITO:  Yes.  Representing West Virginia as the Senator, and Senator Manchin and I, and we have our congressional delegation here -- Congressman Jenkins, Congressman McKinley, and Congressman Mooney.  This is a lifeline to us, and these miners, they mine in West Virginia.  It’s a source of pride for us as a state that we’ve been able to power this country, and that we’ve had the opportunity to provide the energy to this country.  And thank you for being a partner with us and being a leader, President Trump, in this.  We believe in this, and we believe in your commitment to making sure American miners get back to work.  Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  SENATOR PAUL:  This is a big day for Kentucky.  We want to thank President Trump for getting rid of this job-killing regulation.  It was scheduled to cost us thousands of more jobs.  Nobody seemed to care about Kentucky, but I can promise you, Eastern Kentucky voted about 75 percent for Donald J. Trump.  (Applause.)  SENATOR MANCHIN:  Let me just say something very quickly.  There’s not a miner here that’s not an environmentalist.  So when people say that we don’t want to do the right thing -- there’s a balance between the environment and the economy, these miners would be the first ones to tell you.  They’re out in the woods, they’re hunting, they’re fishing, they’re doing everything possible.  All they want is the respect that -- basically they’ve given us the country we have because of the hard work of them and their fathers and grandfathers and all of their family has done.   So I’m so proud.  These are all West Virginians too.  Makes it even prouder for all of us.  So thank you.  God bless you. LEADER MCCONNELL:  Well, Mr. President, you know that the last eight years brought a depression -- a depression -- to Eastern Kentucky, and our folks are so excited to have a pro-coal President.  And we thank you so much for being on our side.  (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT:  Anybody else?  Come on.  Sure.  Absolutely.  You deserve it. LEADER MCCONNELL:  Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT:  You deserve it.  Come on up. PARTICIPANT:  Well, Mr. President, this is an example of what you talked about so much during your campaign.  This is what is going to make America great again.  This is the legislative branch and you working together to keep the promise that you made to put coal miners back to work and to save the coal industry.  If we had not overturned this rule, we were looking at nearly 70,000 jobs across the country, and about 80 percent of our coal reserves being unavailable.  So thank you for your willingness to work with us to get this done.  It’s very, very important to the coal miners of this country and to our electricity grid.  Thank you, Mr. President.  (Applause.)  PARTICIPANT:  As a 45-year miner, I’m very proud to be in this historic building, and I am very proud to be here with my President of the United States, who keeps his word.  And we thank you very much, sir. THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a great honor.  (Applause.) So I want to thank everybody.  And tell your friends back in West Virginia and Kentucky and all the other places where we worked -- Wyoming -- SENATOR HEITKAMP:  North Dakota. REPRESENTATIVE JORDAN:  Ohio. THE PRESIDENT:  North Dakota.  Ohio. REPRESENTATIVE LAMBORN:  Colorado. THE PRESIDENT:  You’re right about that.  They have been fantastic.  Everybody’s been -- actually, everybody’s been great, and we appreciate it very much.  Special people.  Special workers.  We’re bringing it back, and we’re bringing it back fast.  We didn’t have to wait a long period of time.  It’s been very few days since I’ve been here, and I think this is long ahead of schedule, right?  Wouldn’t you say even -- SENATOR MANCHIN:  Absolutely. THE PRESIDENT:  Even you might say -- (laughter) -- this is about four years faster than they thought would have happened.  So it’s my honor.  And, fellas, go back to work, all right?  I think we’ll take them into the Oval Office, right?  Let’s take them into the Oval Office.  Let’s have a little tour, okay?  They’ve probably been there many times before.  (Laughter.)  Come on.  Come with me.  Good.   Thank you, everybody.  Thank you, very much. AIDE:  Sign the bill here.  THE PRESIDENT:  Oh.  (Laughter.) I could have gotten away with it. PARTICIPANT:  It’s the important part. (The President signs the bill.) END 3:53 P.M.

A member of multiple political parties over the years, he also served as a diplomat, a Senator, and a member of the House of Representatives.  The first President who was the son of a President, John Quincy Adams in many respects paralleled the career as well as the temperament and viewpoints of his illustrious father. Born in Braintree, Massachusetts, in 1767, he watched the Battle of Bunker Hill from the top of Penn's Hill above the family farm. As secretary to his father in Europe, he became an accomplished linguist and assiduous diarist. After graduating from Harvard College, he became a lawyer. At age 26 he was appointed Minister to the Netherlands, then promoted to the Berlin Legation. In 1802 he was elected to the United States Senate. Six years later President Madison appointed him Minister to Russia. Serving under President Monroe, Adams was one of America's great Secretaries of State, arranging with England for the joint occupation of the Oregon country, obtaining from Spain the cession of the Floridas, and formulating with the President the Monroe Doctrine. In the political tradition of the early 19th century, Adams as Secretary of State was considered the political heir to the Presidency. But the old ways of choosing a President were giving way in 1824 before the clamor for a popular choice. Within the one and only party--the Republican--sectionalism and factionalism were developing, and each section put up its own candidate for the Presidency. Adams, the candidate of the North, fell behind Gen. Andrew Jackson in both popular and electoral votes, but received more than William H. Crawford and Henry Clay. Since no candidate had a majority of electoral votes, the election was decided among the top three by the House of Representatives. Clay, who favored a program similar to that of Adams, threw his crucial support in the House to the New Englander. Upon becoming President, Adams appointed Clay as Secretary of State. Jackson and his angry followers charged that a ""corrupt bargain"" had taken place and immediately began their campaign to wrest the Presidency from Adams in 1828. Well aware that he would face hostility in Congress, Adams nevertheless proclaimed in his first Annual Message a spectacular national program. He proposed that the Federal Government bring the sections together with a network of highways and canals, and that it develop and conserve the public domain, using funds from the sale of public lands. In 1828, he broke ground for the 185-mile C & 0 Canal. Adams also urged the United States to take a lead in the development of the arts and sciences through the establishment of a national university, the financing of scientific expeditions, and the erection of an observatory. His critics declared such measures transcended constitutional limitations. The campaign of 1828, in which his Jacksonian opponents charged him with corruption and public plunder, was an ordeal Adams did not easily bear. After his defeat he returned to Massachusetts, expecting to spend the remainder of his life enjoying his farm and his books. Unexpectedly, in 1830, the Plymouth district elected him to the House of Representatives, and there for the remainder of his life he served as a powerful leader. Above all, he fought against circumscription of civil liberties. In 1836 southern Congressmen passed a ""gag rule"" providing that the House automatically table petitions against slavery. Adams tirelessly fought the rule for eight years until finally he obtained its repeal. In 1848, he collapsed on the floor of the House from a stroke and was carried to the Speaker's Room, where two days later he died. He was buried--as were his father, mother, and wife--at First Parish Church in Quincy. To the end, ""Old Man Eloquent"" had fought for what he considered right.

Earlier today I had the opportunity to participate in a meeting of the President’s Export Council (PEC) at the White House. Members of the PEC gathered to strategize and discuss ways to reach the President’s goal of doubling our nation’s exports by the end of 2014. In addition, the private sector members of the PEC presented Administration officials with letters of recommendations on topics such as expansion of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), Middle East/North Africa commercial engagement and workforce readiness. We thanked them for their ideas, and underscored the importance of their input to the Administration’s efforts to boost exports.  During the meeting I emphasized the milestone we reached with the signing of the recent trade agreements with Korea, Colombia,and Panama,as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Additionally, I highlighted the importance of the work with Congress that lies ahead to terminate the application of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to Russia now that it will be formally invited to join the World Trade Organization next month.  Other senior officials joining me in today’s meeting were Commerce Secretary John Bryson, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, Small Business Administrator Karen Mills, Chairman of the Export-Import Bank Fred Hochberg,and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Miriam Sapiro; along with White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley and Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett.  Today’s meeting was live streamed on obamawhitehouse.archives.gov. The PEC was established in 1973 by President Richard Nixon.  The initial group consisted of 20 members, all of whom were business executives.  Six years later, in 1979, President Jimmy Carter reconstituted and expanded the PEC.  Council membership grew to the current roster of 48 members and was extended to include leaders of the labor and agriculture communities, members of Congress, and members of the executive branch.

EST THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta.  He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student.  Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito.  And he has had a tremendous career.  He's a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed -- did very, very well.  And so Alex, I've wished him the best.  We just spoke.  And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.  And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved -- weeks late, I have to say that.  Weeks, weeks late.  Office of Management and Budget.  And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition.  Paul Singer has just left.  As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, ""Never Trump.""  And Paul just left and he's given us his total support.  And it's all about unification.  We're unifying the party, and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country.  It's very important to me.  I've been talking about that for a long time, but it's very, very important to me.  So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office.  He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally.  And I appreciate that. I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions.  And I had this time -- we've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible.  Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening.  And we've done some really good work.  We're very proud of that.   And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we'll do some questions -- unless you have no questions.  That's always a possibility.   I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration.  We have made incredible progress.  I don’t think there's ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we've done.   A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it; much of the media doesn’t get it.  They actually get it, but they don’t write it -- let's put it that way.  But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.  The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know.  And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to.  It used to mean, oh, that's good.  Now it means that's good for jobs.  Very different.  Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league -- Ford, General Motors, so many of them.   I'm making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.  And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible.  Maybe it's not, and that's okay too.  Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.  The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people -- tremendous disservice.  We have to talk about it to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control.  The level of dishonesty is out of control. I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country.  I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.  I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure, we're talking about its entrenchment.  As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort -- not all the time -- and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they're honest and fantastic.  But much of it is not -- the distortion.  And we'll talk about it, and you'll be able to ask me questions about it. But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again to take my message straight to the people.  As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy.  To be honest, I inherited a mess -- it’s a mess -- at home and abroad.  A mess.  Jobs are pouring out of the country.  You see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places -- low-pay, low-wages.  Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look.  The Middle East, a disaster.  North Korea -- we’ll take care of it, folks.  We're going to take care of it all.  I just want to let you know I inherited a mess.   Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.  On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders -- much of it you've covered -- to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We've had great conversations with the United Kingdom -- and meetings -- Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada.  Really, really productive conversations.  I would say far more productive than you would understand.  We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs.  It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.   I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis -- he’s over there now, working very hard -- to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world.  It used to be a small group, and now it’s in large sections of the world.  They've spread like cancer.  ISIS has spread like cancer.  Another mess I inherited.   And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who’s totally taken advantage of our previous administration.  And they're the world’s top sponsor of terrorism.  And we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved.  And it’s not properly solved now.  It’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody.   I’ve ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.  I’ve had great support from the Senate.  I’ve had great support from Congress generally.  We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military.  And I will tell you that is my -- I would be so happy if we never had to use it.  But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild.  We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment.  And their equipment is old.  I used it, I talked about it at every stop.  Depleted -- it’s depleted.  It won’t be depleted for long.   And I think one of the reasons I’m standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.  We have to have strong law enforcement also.  So we do not go abroad in the search of war.  We really are searching for peace, but it’s peace through strength.   At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years.  In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people.  These are campaign promises.  Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders.  Well, that's what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half -- strong borders.  They're so surprised -- ""oh, you're having strong borders.""  Well, that's what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else.   One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected.  They lie to the American people in order to get elected.  Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular, but they're necessary for security and for other reasons.  And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians. I’m here following through on what I pledged to do.  That's all I’m doing.  I put it out before the American people.  Got 306 Electoral College votes.  I wasn’t supposed to get 222.  They said there’s no way to get 222; 230 is impossible.  Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable.  We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before.  So that's the way it goes.  I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.   In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they're not happy about it for whatever reason.  But a lot of people are happy about it.  In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida, five o’clock on Saturday, and I heard -- just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.   I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos.  Chaos!  Yet, it is the exact opposite.  This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved, and they’re outstanding people.  Like Senator Dan Coates whose there -- one of the most respected men of the Senate -- he can’t get approved.  How do you not approve him?  He’s been a colleague, highly respected -- brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it -- but waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about, and we can’t let that happen.  So if the Democrats, who have -- all you have to do is look at where they are right now -- the only thing they can do is delay, because they’ve screwed things up royally, believe me.  Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time.  I just got here.  I got here with no Cabinet.  Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people.  So we’ll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming.  We’ve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership.  We’re going to make trade deals, but we’re going to have one-on-one deals -- bilateral.  We’re going to have one-on-one deals. We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories.  People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory.  They go in for a permit -- it’s many, many years.  And then at the end of the process -- they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense -- and at the end of the process, they get rejected.  Now, they may be rejected with me, but it’s going to be a quick rejection.  It's not going to take years.  But mostly, it’s going to be an acceptance.  We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs.  We don’t want the jobs going to other countries.   We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers.  We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations.  We’ve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated.  Makes sense.  Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have.  If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they're a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have.  And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of.  It’s very important to me.  But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing. We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence.  We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others -- taking place right now in our inner cities.  Horrible.  We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs.  We’re becoming a drug-infested nation.  Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we’re not going to let it happen any longer.   We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border.  Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process.  And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me.  The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government.  And we’re going to have a wall that works.  We’re not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.   We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we’ve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border.  No more release, no matter who you are -- release.  We’ve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety.  We are saving American lives every single day.  The court system has not made it easy for us.  And we've even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many. We’ve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country.  Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge’s, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe -- including reporters safe -- and is vigorously defending this lawful order.  I will not back down from defending our country.  I got elected on defense of our country.  And I keep my campaign promises.  And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result.  They already are.  I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places.  In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.  I've heard 80 percent -- I find that hard to believe; that's just a number I heard -- that they're overturned 80 percent of the time.  I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil.  But we are appealing that and we are going further.   We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that.  At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We've also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thousands and thousands of jobs -- and put new ""Buy American"" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines.  In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen.  We want them to use American steel.  And they're willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along.  Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that.  And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel?  And they said, that's a good idea.  We put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.  We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare.  Obamacare is a disaster, folks.  It's a disaster.  You can say, oh, Obamacare -- I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they're not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.  So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back.  We're bringing our jobs back to this country big league.  It's already happening, but big league. I've also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats.  You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years.  That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history.  You look at Rex Tillerson -- he's out there negotiating right now.  General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly.  We have great, great people.  Mick is with us now.  We have great people. Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens.  Now, look, fair trade -- not free -- fair.  If a country is taking advantage of us, we're not going to let that happen anymore.  Every country takes advantage of us, almost.  I may be able to find a couple that don't.  But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.   Jobs have already started to surge.  Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs.  Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs.  They were with me a week ago.  You know -- you were here.  General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave.  And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left.  And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.   Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with.  And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs.  Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives.  There will be many, many more.  Many more.  These are a few that we're naming. Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades and decades and decades, folks.  And we’re not going to let that happen anymore.  Not going to let it happen. And one more thing.  I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution -- highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats -- you may not see that, but he’ll get there one way or the other.  But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes. This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country.  Again, I say it -- there has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time.  And we haven’t even started the big work that starts early next week.  Some very big things are going to be announced next week.   So we’re just getting started.  We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m.  I hope to see you there.  And with that, I’d just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions.  Mara.  Mara, go ahead.  You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference. Q    Did you fire Mike Flynn? THE PRESIDENT:  Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation.  He respectfully gave it.  He is a man who -- there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today.  And I was not happy with the way that information was given.   He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw.  What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally.  That’s the real problem.  And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it.  In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- they know nothing about it.  They weren’t in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call.  It’s all fake news.  It’s all fake news. The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara -- and I think it’s very important -- the illegal giving out classified information.  And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much.  I’ll give you an example.  I called, as you know, Mexico.  It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico.  And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that’s -- I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call.  All of a sudden it’s out for the world to see.  It’s supposed to be secret.  It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case.  Same thing with Australia.  All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place.   The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn.  Everybody saw this, and I’m saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that’s classified?  How do they do it?  You know why?  Because it’s an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves.  But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves.  Really ashamed. Yes, go ahead. Q    Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?  THE PRESIDENT:  Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don’t think he did anything wrong.  If anything, he did something right.  He was coming into office, he looked at the information.  He said, huh, that’s fine, that’s what they’re supposed to do.  They’re supposed to be -- and he didn’t just call Russia.  He called and spoke to, both ways -- I think there were 30-some-odd countries.  He’s doing the job. You know, he was just doing his job.  The thing is he didn’t tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn’t remember.  So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me.  And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision. But he didn’t tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn’t remember.  And that just wasn’t acceptable to me.   Yes. Q    President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I'm looking for some clarification here.  During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence?  And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?   THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday.  And it was very much discredited, as you know.  It was -- it’s a joke.  And the people mentioned in the story -- I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia.  They weren’t even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part -- I hadn’t spoken to them.  I think the one person, I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him.  I don’t think I’ve ever met him.  And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time.  I don’t think I ever met him.  Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him.  I didn’t talk to him, ever.  And he thought it was a joke. The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call.  Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera.  And the other person, people knew that he’d represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia -- but knew that he represented various countries.  That's what he does.  I mean, people know that.  That's Mr. Manafort, who's, by the way -- who's, by the way, a respected man.  He’s a respected man.  But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody.  But everybody -- people knew that.  Everybody knew that.  So these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia.  And he said that very forcefully.  I saw his statement.  He said it very forcefully.  Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories.   So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it.  And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia.  I have no loans in Russia.  I don't have any deals in Russia.  President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election.  He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific.  But so did many other leaders -- almost all other leaders from almost all other countries.  So that's the extent. Russia is fake news.  Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media.  The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there -- because we have our new people going in place right now.  As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA.  James Comey at FBI.  Dan Coats is waiting to be approved.  I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one.  And he’s still waiting to be approved.  But our new people are going in.   And just while you're at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Times’s story yesterday.  And it talked about -- you saw it, front page.  So, Director of National Intelligence just put out -- acting -- a statement:  “Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community” -- this was just given to us -- “is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.” So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal -- top -- and they just wrote the story is not true.  And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest -- because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media.  I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest.  But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media.  How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me?  Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page?  That was like that story they wrote about the women and me -- front page.  Big massive story.  And it was nasty.  And then they called.  They said, ""We never said that.  We like Mr. Trump.""  They called up my office -- we like Mr. Trump; we never said that.  And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you -- totally misrepresented.  I said, give us a retraction.  They never gave us a retraction.  And, frankly, I then went on to other things. Go ahead.   Q    Mr. President --  THE PRESIDENT:  You okay? Q    I am.  Just wanted to get untangled.  Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes.  In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008. THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m talking about Republican.  Yes.  Q    President Obama, 332.  George H.W. Bush, 426 when he won as President.  So why should Americans trust --   THE PRESIDENT:  Well, no, I was told -- I was given that information.  I don't know.  I was just given.  We had a very, very big margin.  Q    I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you're providing information that's fake? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know.  I was given that information.  I was given -- actually, I’ve seen that information around.  But it was a very substantial victory.  Do you agree with that?  Q    You're the President.   THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, thank you.  That's a good answer.  Yes. Q    Mr. President, thank you so much.  Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn -- there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed?  Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with?  What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing?   And further than that, sir, you've said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks. THE PRESIDENT:  We are. Q    Can we ask what you're doing to do?  And also, we've heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg.  What can you tell us about that? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they're in position.  So I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else.  The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man.  And he has offered his services, and it’s something we may take advantage of.  But I don't think we’ll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we're going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own. As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn't sound wrong.  My counsel came -- Don McGahn, White House Counsel -- and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself.  He said he doesn't think anything is wrong.  He really didn't think -- it was really what happened after that, but he didn't think anything was done wrong.  I didn't either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it.  I said, well, I don't see -- to me, he was doing the job.   The information was provided by -- who I don't know -- Sally Yates -- and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there.  But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable.  As far as the actual making the call -- in fact, I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job.  That was very normal.  At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong.  After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So -- and I do -- and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.   Yes, Jon. Q    On the leaks, sir --  THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead, finish off, then I'll get you, Jon. Q    Sorry, what will you do on the leaks?  You have said twice today --  THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, we're looking at it very, very seriously.  I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks.  Those are criminal leaks.  They're put out by people either in agencies.  I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in.  You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate.  We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example.  So we are looking into that very seriously.  It's a criminal act.   You know what I say -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked.  Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment.  When I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised.  But I said, you know, it doesn't make sense, that won't happen.  But that wasn't that important to call, it was fine.  I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world -- the President who is a very fine man, by the way.  Same thing with Australia.  I said, that's terrible that it was leaked but it wasn't that important.  But then I said, what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea?  What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East?  Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information -- very important, very -- I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too? So I don't want classified information getting out to the public.  And in a way, that was almost a test.  So I'm dealing with Mexico.  I'm dealing with Argentina.  We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn.  All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times.  And I'm saying, what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East?  What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea?  We've got to stop it.  That's why it's a criminal penalty. Yes, Jon. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point.  Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign?  And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the leaks are real.  You're the one that wrote about them and reported them.  I mean, the leaks are real.  You know what they said -- you saw it.  And the leaks are absolutely real.  The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.   So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit -- than reporters, than good reporters.  It's very important to me, and especially in this position.  It's very important.  I don't mind bad stories.  I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true.  And over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm okay with that.  But I'm not okay when it is fake.  I mean, I watch CNN -- it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred.  I don't watch it anymore because it's very good -- he's saying no.  It's okay, Jim.  It's okay, Jim.  You’ll have your chance.  But I watch others too.  You’re not the only one, so don’t feel badly. But I think it should be straight.  I think it should be -- I think it would be, frankly, more interesting.  I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be -- I think that it would actually be better.   People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress.  I think that’s right.  I don’t know, Peter, is that one right?  Because you know, I think they have lower -- I heard, lower than Congress.   But honestly, the public would appreciate it.  I’d appreciate it.  Again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true.  But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult.  I think we’re setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet.  I mean, the numbers are crazy.  When I’m looking -- some of them had them approved immediately.  I’m going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for. And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying.  And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there, and they have nothing going.  The only thing they can do is delay.  And you know, I think they’d be better served by approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody is good.  And sometimes, I mean -- I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way.  And that’s okay.  That’s fine. But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly.  This is pure delay tactics.  And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jim. Q    The first part of my question on contacts.  Do you definitively say that nobody --  THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I had nothing to do with it.  I have nothing to do with Russia.  I told you, I have no deals there.  I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give -- they’re not giving classified information.  They’re giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates -- which, by the way, nobody mentions.  Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.  Can you imagine -- seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions?  It would be the electric chair, okay?  “He should be put in the electric chair.”  You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay?  Maybe not you, Jon. Yes, we’ll do you next, Jim.  I’ll do you next.  Yes? Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to clarify one other thing. THE PRESIDENT:  Sure. Q    Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian ambassador? THE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t.  No, I didn’t.   Q    (Inaudible.)  (Off mic.) THE PRESIDENT:  No, I didn’t.   Q    Did you fire him because (inaudible) --  THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me -- no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple.  Mike was doing his job.  He was calling countries and his counterparts.  So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it.  I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it.  I didn’t direct him but I would have directed him because that’s his job. And it came out that way -- and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job.  And I agreed with him.  And since then I’ve watched many other people say that. No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it, okay?   Jim. Q    Mr. President, thank you very much.  And just for the record, we don’t hate you, I don’t hate you.  If you could pass that along.   THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay? Q    If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir.   THE PRESIDENT:  Well, not too many.  We do have other people.  You do have other people, and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting. Q    They're pretty good right now, actually. THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Go ahead, Jim. Q    If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle.  You welcomed that at one point. THE PRESIDENT:  I was okay with it. Q    You said you loved WikiLeaks.  At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails.  I’m wondering, sir, if you -- THE PRESIDENT:  Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that’s okay. Q    Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too. THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that. Q    If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign. THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, fair question.  Ready? Q    So if I may ask you that -- if I may ask a follow-up -- THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, but are you -- let me do one at a time.  Do you mind? Q    Yes, sir. THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  So in one case you’re talking about highly classified information.  In the other case you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss.  I will say this:  If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.  He said terrible things about her.  But it wasn’t classified information.   But in one case you’re talking about classified.  Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism.  I don’t want to be hacked.  And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that.  And if they did it, they could not have been hacked.  But they were hacked, and terrible things came.  And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things, I said -- I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page.  It wasn’t even in the papers. Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers.  I would have been the headline in every newspaper.   I mean, think of it.  They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself.  Why didn’t Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job""? Q    And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about -- you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake.  I guess I don't understand.  It seems that there is a disconnect there.  If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the reporting is fake.  Look, look --  Q    And if I may ask -- I just want to ask one other question.   THE PRESIDENT:  Jim, you know what it is?  Here’s the thing.  The public isn’t -- they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.  They don't know if it’s true or false because they're not involved.  I’m involved.  I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life.  But I’m involved.  So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.   I just see many, many untruthful things.  And I tell you what else I see.  I see tone.  You know the word “tone.”  The tone is such hatred.  I’m really not a bad person, by the way.  No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that.  The tone is such hatred.   I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say “Fox & Friends” in the morning, they're very honorable people.  They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.  But they have the most honest morning show.  That's all I can say.  It’s the most honest.  But the tone, Jim.  If you look -- the hatred.  I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets --  Q    (Off mic.) THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening.  You just take a look at that show.  That is a constant hit.  The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.  The good news is he doesn't have good ratings.  But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.  And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network. Now, I will say this.  I watch it.  I see it.  I’m amazed by it.  And I just think you’d be a lot better off -- I honestly do.  The public gets it, you know.  Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.  They want to throw their placards at CNN.   I think you would do much better by being different.  But you just take a look.  Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.  If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s brutal.   Now, they’ll take this news conference.  I’m actually having a very good time, okay?  But they’ll take this news conference -- don't forget that's the way I won.  Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.  Q    (Off mic.) THE PRESIDENT:  No, that's how I won.  I won with news conferences and probably speeches.  I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people, that's for sure.  But I am having a good time.  Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.  I’m not ranting and raving.  I’m just telling you, you're dishonest people.  But -- but I’m not ranting and raving.  I love this.  I’m having a good time doing it.  But tomorrow the headlines are going to be:  Donald Trump Rants and Raves.  I’m not ranting and raving.  Q    If I may just --  THE PRESIDENT:  Go ahead. Q    One more follow-up because --  THE PRESIDENT:  Should I let him have a little bit more?  What do you think, Peter?   Q    Just because of this --  THE PRESIDENT:  Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more?  Sit down.  Sit down.   Q    Just because of the attack --  THE PRESIDENT:  We’ll get it.   Q    Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir --  THE PRESIDENT:  I’m changing it from fake news, though. Q    Doesn't that undermine --  THE PRESIDENT:  Very fake news now.  (Laughter.)  Q    But aren’t you --  THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead.   Q    Real news, Mr. President.  Real news.  THE PRESIDENT:  And you're not related to our new --  Q    I am not related, sir, no.  (Laughter.)  I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say. THE PRESIDENT:  I looked -- you know, I looked at that name.  I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there?  Alex Acosta.  Q    I’m sure you checked that out, sir. THE PRESIDENT:  No, I checked it.  I said -- they said, no, sir.  I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.   Q    But aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don't like “fake news”?  Why not just say it’s a story I don't like?  THE PRESIDENT:  I do that. Q    When you call it fake news, you're undermining confidence --  THE PRESIDENT:  No, I do that.  No, no, I do that. Q    -- in our news media. THE PRESIDENT:  Here’s the thing.   Q    Isn’t that important? THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, I understand -- and you're right about that except this.  See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad.  And sometimes I’ll say, wow, that's going to be a great story, and I’ll get killed.  I know what’s good and bad.  I’d be a pretty good reporter -- not as good as you.  But I know what’s good.  I know what’s bad.   And when they change it and make it really bad -- something that should be positive.  Sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make okay.  They’ll even make it negative.  So I understand it because I’m there.  I know what was said.  I know who is saying it.  I’m there.  So it’s very important to me.   Look, I want to see an honest press.  When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press.  The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore.  Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don't know.  But they don't believe you.   If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right?  Of course, he had some questions also.  But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world -- including bad stories about me.  But if you go -- as an example, you're CNN -- I mean, it’s story after story after story is bad.  I won.  I won.  And the other thing:  Chaos.  There’s zero chaos.  We are running -- this is a fine-tuned machine.  And Reince happens to be doing a good job.  But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.   I said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks.  But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper.  And I’m saying, here’s my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC.  I mean, we won the election, right?  We won the presidency.  We got some senators.  We got some -- all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job.  And I said to myself, you know -- and I said to somebody that was in the room -- I said, you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires.  They're fake.  They're not true.  And isn't that a shame, because he'd rather be working on health care.  He'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim.  I mean that.  I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right.  I sort of understand there's a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody -- for whatever reason.  And I understand that.  But you've got to be at least a little bit fair.  And that's why the public sees it -- they see it.  They see it's not fair.  You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.  And the public is smart.  They understand it.   Okay, yeah, go ahead.   Q    We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible).  But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news?  And secondly --  THE PRESIDENT:  I think they don't believe it.  I don't think the public would.  That's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof.  I don't think they believe it.  Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing -- that's a ruse.  That's a ruse.  And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that.  Now, tomorrow you'll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible.  It's not terrible -- it's good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset.  We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country.  You know what uranium is, right?  It's this thing called nuclear weapons and other things.  Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things.  Nobody talks about that.  I didn't do anything for Russia.  I've done nothing for Russia.  Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium.  Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?  Here, take a look.  He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button?  Hillary Clinton -- that was a reset.  Remember?  It said ""reset.""  Now, if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy.  If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing.  We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly.  And I told him, I said, I know politically it's probably not good for me.  Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water.  Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it's so great.  That's not great.  That's not great.  I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you've had a lot of Presidents that haven't taken that tact.  Look where we are now.  Look where we are now.  So, if I can -- now, I love to negotiate things.  I do it really well and all that stuff, but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin.  Maybe it is.  But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people -- the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia.  And probably Putin said, you know -- he's sitting behind his desk and he's saying, you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it's got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story.  Okay?  And that's a shame.  Because if we could get along with Russia -- and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone -- if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing. Q    Tax reform -- Q    Mr. President, since you --  THE PRESIDENT:  Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly.  We're doing Obamacare -- we're in final stages.  We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say.  And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first.  It's not like -- frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner.  So we'll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March.  And after that, we're going to come up -- and we're doing very well on tax reform. Yes. Q    Mr. President, you mentioned Russia.  Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States. THE PRESIDENT:  Okay. Q    You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States. THE PRESIDENT:  Not good. Q    There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation --  THE PRESIDENT:  Not good. Q    -- of the agreement between the two countries.  And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.   THE PRESIDENT:  Not good. Q    I listened to you during the campaign --  THE PRESIDENT:  Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen?  It happened when -- if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we're back to the old games with the United States.  There's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the -- you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn't that wonderful.  But I know you well enough.  Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn't have done that.  Look, of all --  Q    I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those --  THE PRESIDENT:  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait.  Excuse me just one second.   Q    I'm just trying to find out what you're doing to do about them, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT:  All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal.  So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed.  They all tried.  But I'm different than those people. Go ahead. Q    How are you interpreting those moves?  And what do you intend to do about them? THE PRESIDENT:  Just the way I said it. Q    Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal? THE PRESIDENT:  I have.  I have.  And I'm so beautifully represented.  I'm so honored that the Senate approved him.  He's going to be fantastic. Yes, I think that I've already --  Q    Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir? THE PRESIDENT:  No, I don't think so.  I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal.  I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now.  Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal. Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal.  I don't know.  We might, we might not.  But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better.  But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people.  And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world. If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.  There's no upside.  We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they.  I've been briefed.  And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it:  Nuclear holocaust would be like no other.  They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. Q    So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are --  THE PRESIDENT:  Who did I say is not good? Q    No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said they're not good. THE PRESIDENT:  No, it's not good, but they happened. Q    But do they damage the relationship?  Do they undermine this country’s ability to work with Russia? THE PRESIDENT:  They all happened recently, and I understand what they’re doing, because they’re doing the same thing.  Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried.  And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump?  Does anybody in this room really believe that?  Okay. But I tell you one thing:  She tried to make a deal.  She had the reset.  She gave all the valuable uranium away.  She did other things.  You know, they say I’m close to Russia.  Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States.  She’s close to Russia.  I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia?  You know what I gave?  Nothing. Q    Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations? THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do.  I don’t talk about military response.  I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months.  ""We are going to attack Mosul in four months.""  Then three months later:  ""We are going to attack Mosul in one month.""  ""Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.""  In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult.  Do you know why?  Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things.  You’re going to be surprised to hear that.  And, by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that.  So I don’t have to tell you -- Q    There will be a response? THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, “Yes, here’s what we’re going to do.”  I don’t have to do that. Q    There will be a -- in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?   THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.  Wait a minute.  I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea.  And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran.  You know why?  Because they shouldn’t know.  And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.  So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship -- the Russian ship, as an example -- I’m not going to tell you.  But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything.  But I’m not going to tell you.  Okay. Q    Thanks. Q    Can I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President -- the Trump -- THE PRESIDENT:  Where are you from? Q    BBC. THE PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Here’s another beauty. Q    That’s a good line.  Impartial, free, and fair. THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, sure. Q    Mr. President -- THE PRESIDENT:  Just like CNN, right? Q    Mr. President, on the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth.  On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned --  THE PRESIDENT:  Yeah, I do.  I do.   And let me tell you about the travel --  Q    Were there any mistakes in that? THE PRESIDENT:  Wait, wait, wait.  I know who you are.  Just wait.  Let me tell you about the travel ban.  We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court.  We got a bad decision.  We had a court that’s been overturned -- again, maybe wrong, but I think it’s 80 percent of the time.  A lot.  We had a bad decision.  We’re going to keep going with that decision.  We’re going to put in a new executive order next week sometime.  But we had a bad decision.  That’s the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.   You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports.  You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations.  Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court.  We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision.  Very bad for the safety and security of our country.  The rollout was perfect. Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing -- and I said this to my people:  Give them a one-month period of time.  But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month -- the bad ones.  You do agree, there are bad people out there, right?  They’re not everybody that’s like you.  You have some bad people out there.   So Kelly said, you can’t do that.  And he was right.  As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it.  I said, how about one week?  He said, no good.  You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don’t have time to come in.  Now, nobody ever reports that, but that’s why we did it quickly. Now, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect.  The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country. Now, in the meantime, we’ve vetting very, very strongly.  Very, very strongly.  But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed. Q    Just a brief follow-up.  And if it’s so urgent, why not introduce -- THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, go ahead. Q    Thank you.  I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia.  Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing.  So that’s one person.  But he was dealing -- as he should have been -- Q    During the election? THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, nobody that I know of. Q    So you’re not aware of any contacts during the course of the election? THE PRESIDENT:  Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?   Q    Can you just say yes or no on it? THE PRESIDENT:  Russia is a ruse.  Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important.  Russia is a ruse.  I have nothing to do with Russia, haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years.  Don’t speak to people from Russia.  Not that I wouldn’t, I just have nobody to speak to.  I spoke to Putin twice.  He called me on the election -- I told you this -- and he called me on the inauguration, and a few days ago.  We had a very good talk, especially the second one -- lasted for a pretty long period of time.  I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified, so I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it.  But we had a very, very good talk.  I have nothing to do with Russia.  To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.   Now, Manafort has totally denied it.  He denied it.  Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia.  I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever.  But people knew that.  Everybody knew that. Q    But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election? THE PRESIDENT:  I have -- you know what, he said no.  I can only tell you what he -- now, he was replaced long before the election.  You know that, right?  He was replaced long before the election.  When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election.  But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also, by the way -- Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place.  He was only there for a short period of time. How much longer should we stay here, folks?  Five more minutes, is that okay?  Five?   Q    Mr. President, on national security -- THE PRESIDENT:  Wait, let’s see, who’s -- I want to find a friendly reporter.  Are you a friendly reporter?  Watch how friendly he is.  Wait, wait -- watch how friendly he is.  Go ahead.  Go ahead. Q    So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine.  And (inaudible).  I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic.  We have an understanding of (inaudible). THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. Q    However, what we are concerned about, and what we haven’t really heard be addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.  There have been reports out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks.  There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to -- THE PRESIDENT:  You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question.  And it’s not.  It’s not.  Not a simple question, not a fair question.  Okay, sit down.  I understand the rest of your question.   So here’s the story, folks.  Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.  Number two, racism -- the least racist person.  In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.   Q    (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:  Quiet, quiet, quiet.  See, he lied about -- he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question.  So you know, welcome to the world of the media.  But let me just tell you something -- that I hate the charge.  I find it repulsive.  I hate even the question because people that know me -- and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday -- did you hear him, Bibi?  He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it. So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that. Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead. Q    Thank you.  I’m Lisa from the PBS -- THE PRESIDENT:  See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is.   Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Lisa Desjardins from the PBS Newshour. THE PRESIDENT:  Good. Q    On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines?  Will it be focused on specific countries? THE PRESIDENT:  It’s a very fair question. Q    And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration, what is your plan?  Do you plan to continue that program or to end it? THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to show great heart.  DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you.  To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases -- not in all cases.  In some of the cases they’re having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers too.  But you have some absolutely incredible kids -- I would say mostly -- they were brought here in such a way -- it's a very, very tough subject. We are going to deal with DACA with heart.  I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is right.  And I appreciate your understanding on that. But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me.  Because, you know, I love these kids.  I love kids.  I have kids and grandkids.  And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do.  And you know, the law is rough.  I'm not talking about new laws.  I'm talking the existing law is very rough.  It's very, very rough.   As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more.  But we're tailoring it now to the decision.  We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it.  And the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court.  Okay? Q    Mr. President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.   THE PRESIDENT:  Yes. Q    And she does a lot of great work for the country as well.  Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country?  And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you? THE PRESIDENT:  Now, that's what I call a nice question.  That is very nice.  Who are you with? Q    (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:  Good.  I'm going to start watching.  Thank you very much. Melania is terrific.  She was here last night.  We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely.  And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba.  And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans.  And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding.  That's right, she just opened up the Visitors Center -- in other words, touring of the White House.   She, like others that she's working with, feels very, very strongly about women's issues, women's difficulties, very, very strongly.  And she's a very, very strong advocate.  I think she's a great representative for this country.  And a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned.  The things they say -- I've known her for a long time.  She was a very successful person.  She was a very successful model.  She did really well.  She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people.  She was a very private person.  She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find.  And the things they say -- and I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair.  And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies. I'd just tell you this:  I think she's going to be a fantastic First Lady.  She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people.  And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman.  And they're not doing this for money.  They're not doing this for pay.  They're doing this because they feel it, both of them.  And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House.  Thank you.  That's a very nice question. Go ahead. Q    Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Oh, this is going to be a bad question but that's okay. Q    No, it's not going to be a bad question. THE PRESIDENT:  Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Q    Well, thank you so much.  Mr. President, I need to find out from you -- you said something as it relates to inner cities.  That was one of your platforms during your campaign.  THE PRESIDENT:  Fix the inner cities, yes. Q    Fixing the inner cities.  What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order that's coming out this afternoon?  See, it wasn't bad, was it? THE PRESIDENT:  That was very professional and very good. Q    I'm very professional. THE PRESIDENT:  We'll be announcing the order in a little while, and I'd rather let the order speak for itself.  But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned.  But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign.  I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get.  We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher.  And, by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime.  We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know it takes a long time.  It's taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly. But we’re going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education.  And also, we’re going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime.  You go to some of these inner city places, and it’s so sad when you look at the crime.  You have people -- and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it.  In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it.  They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day.  They’re living in hell.  We can’t let that happen.  So we’re going to be very, very strong. It’s a great question, and it’s a very difficult situation, because it’s been many, many years.  It’s been festering for many, many years.  But we have places in this country that we have to fix.  We have to help African American people that, for the most part are stuck there -- Hispanic American people.  We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they’re living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago.  There are two Chicagos, as you know.  There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all, and safe.  There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts.  So we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities.  I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. Q    Well, when you say -- when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as your -- THE PRESIDENT:  Am I going include who? Q    Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as --  THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I would.  I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?  Do you want to set up the meeting? Q    No, no, no.  THE PRESIDENT:  Are they friends of yours? Q    I’m just a reporter.   THE PRESIDENT:  No, go ahead, set up the meeting. Q    I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now. THE PRESIDENT:  Let’s go set up a meeting.  I would love to meet with the Black Caucus.  I think it’s great -- the Congressional Black Caucus.  I think it’s great.  I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically, I can’t have that meeting.  I was all set to have the meeting.  You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set.  I spoke to him on the phone.  Very nice guy. Q    I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well. THE PRESIDENT:  He wanted it.  But we called, called, called, called -- they can’t make a meeting with him.  Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him.  Because I do want to solve the problem.  But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that -- some other lightweight -- he was probably told -- he was probably told, don’t meet with Trump, it’s bad politics.  And that’s part of the problem of this country. Okay, one more.  Go ahead. Q    Yes, Mr. President, two questions -- THE PRESIDENT:  No, no.  One question.  Two, we can’t handle.  This room can’t handle two.  Go ahead, give me the better of your two. Q    (Inaudible) it's not about your personality or your beliefs.  We’re talking about (inaudible) around the country, some of it by supporters in your name.  What do you -- THE PRESIDENT:  And some of it -- and can I be honest with you?  And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up.  Some of it written by our opponents.  You do know that.  Do you understand that?  You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that.  Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side, and you think it’s like playing it straight.  No.  But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side.  They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate.  It won’t be my people.  It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you.  Okay. Go ahead. Q    You are the President now.  What are you going to do about it? THE PRESIDENT:  Who is that?  Where is that?  Oh, stand up.  You can -- Q    What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed? THE PRESIDENT:  Oh, I’m working on it.  No, I’m working on it very hard.   Q    Are you going to give a speech? THE PRESIDENT:  No, no, look.  Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama.  Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided.  I didn’t come along and divide this country.  This country was seriously divided before I got here.   We’re going to work on it very hard.  One of the questions that was asked -- I thought it was a very good question -- was about the inner cities.  I mean, that’s part of it.  But we’re going to work on education.  We’re going to work on lack -- you know, we’re going to stop -- we’re going to try and stop the crime.  We have great law enforcement officials.  We’re going to try and stop crime.  We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime.  But it’s very important to me.  But this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation.  We went eight years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama.  We lived in a divided nation.  And I am going to try -- I will do everything within my power to fix that.   I want to thank everybody very much.  It’s a great honor to be with you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)  END    2:13 P.M.

On his 32nd day, he became the first to die in office, serving the shortest tenure in U.S. Presidential history. ""Give him a barrel of hard cider and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him, and my word for it,"" a Democratic newspaper foolishly gibed, ""he will sit ... by the side of a 'sea coal' fire, and study moral philosophy. "" The Whigs, seizing on this political misstep, in 1840 presented their candidate William Henry Harrison as a simple frontier Indian fighter, living in a log cabin and drinking cider, in sharp contrast to an aristocratic champagne-sipping Van Buren. Harrison was in fact a scion of the Virginia planter aristocracy. He was born at Berkeley in 1773. He studied classics and history at Hampden-Sydney College, then began the study of medicine in Richmond. Suddenly, that same year, 1791, Harrison switched interests. He obtained a commission as ensign in the First Infantry of the Regular Army, and headed to the Northwest, where he spent much of his life. In the campaign against the Indians, Harrison served as aide-de-camp to General ""Mad Anthony"" Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, which opened most of the Ohio area to settlement. After resigning from the Army in 1798, he became Secretary of the Northwest Territory, was its first delegate to Congress, and helped obtain legislation dividing the Territory into the Northwest and Indiana Territories. In 1801 he became Governor of the Indiana Territory, serving 12 years. His prime task as governor was to obtain title to Indian lands so settlers could press forward into the wilderness. When the Indians retaliated, Harrison was responsible for defending the settlements. The threat against settlers became serious in 1809. An eloquent and energetic chieftain, Tecumseh, with his religious brother, the Prophet, began to strengthen an Indian confederation to prevent further encroachment. In 1811 Harrison received permission to attack the confederacy. While Tecumseh was away seeking more allies, Harrison led about a thousand men toward the Prophet's town. Suddenly, before dawn on November 7, the Indians attacked his camp on Tippecanoe River. After heavy fighting, Harrison repulsed them, but suffered 190 dead and wounded. The Battle of Tippecanoe, upon which Harrison's fame was to rest, disrupted Tecumseh's confederacy but failed to diminish Indian raids. By the spring of 1812, they were again terrorizing the frontier. In the War of 1812 Harrison won more military laurels when he was given the command of the Army in the Northwest with the rank of brigadier general. At the Battle of the Thames, north of Lake Erie, on October 5, 1813, he defeated the combined British and Indian forces, and killed Tecumseh. The Indians scattered, never again to offer serious resistance in what was then called the Northwest. Thereafter Harrison returned to civilian life; the Whigs, in need of a national hero, nominated him for President in 1840. He won by a majority of less than 150,000, but swept the Electoral College, 234 to 60. When he arrived in Washington in February 1841, Harrison let Daniel Webster edit his Inaugural Address, ornate with classical allusions. Webster obtained some deletions, boasting in a jolly fashion that he had killed ""seventeen Roman proconsuls as dead as smelts, every one of them."" Webster had reason to be pleased, for while Harrison was nationalistic in his outlook, he emphasized in his Inaugural that he would be obedient to the will of the people as expressed through Congress. But before he had been in office a month, he caught a cold that developed into pneumonia. On April 4, 1841, he died -- the first President to die in office -- and with him died the Whig program.

Brady Press Briefing Room  1:48 P.M. EST MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Just a few minutes ago, as many of you had seen, we had another example of the real-world results that the Trump administration is getting in its pro-jobs agenda.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that his company is opening a high-tech manufacturing facility in Arizona that will create roughly 10,000 jobs between the factory itself and its supply chain, which is the latest wave in economic optimism that's sweeping the country following the President's victory. In his inaugural address, the President laid out an ambitious vision to create 25 million jobs over the next decade.  From the beginning of his campaign, bringing jobs back to our struggling community has been one of the parts of the President's message that most resonated with the American people.  Having hired tens of thousands of people himself, the President is keenly aware of what prevents businesses from being successful and creating jobs in the current economy. President Obama, by contrast, visited the same factory site where this factory will be built during his last reelection visit in 2012, touting the government incentives that were supposed to bring back jobs that had been lost to Asia.  President Trump knows that for business, the real government incentive is the government restraining itself.  For too many years, Washington has smothered industry in this country and under burdensome regulation.  This administration will set out to free businesses from constraints of government bureaucracy and regulation.   Under the President's ""Buy American, Hire American"" agenda, the government is going to get out of the way of businesses to allow them to thrive.  Just last week, the President signed what we've been calling the ""one in, two out"" executive order requiring that every new federal regulation that's adopted, two be eliminated.  This new rule will provide much-needed relief for businesses who have been regulated and saddled with an absolutely staggering amount of additional red tape, as much as $1.9 trillion per year by some estimates.   In 2014, the National Association of Manufacturers calculated that companies in every industry paid an average of $9,991 per employee to comply with federal regulations.  And it's only gotten worse since that study was conducted.  By relieving even a small portion of this burden, we will allow businesses to grow and hire more people.  Projects that have been stalled or scuttled are being revived in anticipation of the President's pro-growth policies.  Last quarter, confidence among CEOs of U.S.-based companies jumped by 4.2 percent points in the YPO Global Pulse Survey, one of the single-largest quarter gains in history.  This is only the beginning of the President's agenda. Moving on to recap the President's afternoon and evening yesterday, as you saw, we officially announced the 24 people who will be serving in the President's -- in his Cabinet, on the White House website yesterday.  The President looks forward to having all these distinguished qualified men and women in place as heads of departments and agencies so that our government can start fully working for the American people and enacting the agenda that he brought forward during the last campaign. The President spoke with two foreign leaders yesterday.  During his call with President Rajoy of Spain, the two leaders discussed our shared priorities, including efforts to eliminate ISIS.  The President additionally reiterated the United States' commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and emphasized the importance of NATO allies and sharing the burden of defense spending.  President Trump also spoke with President Erdogan of Turkey, during which he conveyed U.S. support to Turkey as a strategic partner and NATO ally, and welcomed Turkey's contributions to the fight against ISIS.  Last night, the President had an incredibly meaningful visit with current officers who enrolled in the Green Beret's Qualifications Course.  These young men and women will be at the tip of the spear serving our country in some of the world's most dangerous places as intelligence officers.  The President told these brave young soldiers how proud he was of their commitment, to risk everything to keep us safe, and how humbled he was to serve as their Commander-in-Chief, and that they could always count on him to have their back. Also, yesterday, the Department of Justice presented its arguments before the 9th Circuit Court in the case concerning the temporary restraining order on the President's national security executive order.  Again, as I did yesterday, I want to emphasize that the issue before the 9th Circuit right now is extremely narrow.  The question is simply whether or not the President's executive order, which we maintain is fully lawful under the Constitution and U.S. code, should remain in effect while the courts actually consider it on its merits.  We expect the court to issue a decision on this matter soon, and we will have a statement once that's done. Today, the President spoke before the Major Cities police chiefs and the Major County Sheriffs Winter Conference.  In his remarks, the President reiterated his commitment to a great national partnership between his administration and law enforcement.  While there are many things that the federal government can do to improve safety in our communities, it truly rests with the police officers, sheriffs and deputies who risk their lives every day on our streets.  And their mission is critical to the future of this country.  These brave men and women have a true friend in the White House.  And as the President said many times, we must protect those who protect us.  He will continue to do that throughout his administration.   Later this afternoon, the President will participate in a standing legislative strategy meeting of his team here.  The team has been working around the clock to engage lawmakers and get the President's agenda moving through Congress.   Yesterday, the Vice President attended the Republican Policy lunch where he discussed how the administration will work with the Senate to deliver results for the American people.   Of course, the Vice President also cast a historic vote for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos on the floor of the Senate, and then later swore her in in his office across the street.   The larger intergovernmental affairs team is maintaining direct communications to state, local and tribal leaders so that we know what issues are affecting local communities.  So far, they've contacted all GOP state speakers of the house, state senate presidents, and attorneys general, and all but eight GOP state Senate majority leaders.   Our legislative team is also obviously engaged in Judge Gorsuch's nomination.  He had another full day of meetings in the Senate with both Republicans and Democrats.  He met this morning with Senators Flake and Heitkamp.  And this afternoon he'll meet with Senators Cotton, Blumenthal, McCaskill and Heller.  We're also pleased to see another Democrat, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, come out and say that the eminently qualified Judge Gorsuch deserves an up or down vote.  That brings up now to nine total Democrats who have come out and expressed a willingness to treat Judge Gorsuch fairly.  We hope more Democrats will continue to join their colleagues in fulfilling their constitutional duty to offer advice and consent on the President's nominee. Also, on the Hill, we expect Attorney General-designate Sessions to receive a full vote on the floor of the Senate tonight.  As unfortunately has become commonplace in the Senate, Democrats once again spent hours last night in a counterproductive discussion about one of President's clearly qualified nominees, not to mention one of their peers.  Senator Sessions has a long and distinguished legal career, serving as both the U.S. attorney of the southern district of Alabama, and also as Alabama's attorney general.  The President looks forward to Senator Sessions's return to the Department of Justice where he will continue his service to our nation as our chief law enforcement officer.  We also anticipate votes later this week on Secretary-designate Price and Mnuchin. Finally, before I open it up for questions, the White House has spoken with the governor of Louisiana about the severe where in the Gulf Coast.  We've also made contact with the mayors of the affected areas.  FEMA is monitoring the situation around the clock and is in the process of deploying teams to support response and recovery activities.  At this time, there have been no additional requests for federal assistance, and we'll update you should that change. With that, let me go to the first question from Courtis Fuller from WLWT NBC in Cincinnati, Ohio.   Q    Good afternoon.  Cincinnati, among other cities, has recently voted to become a sanctuary city.  City leaders here are vowing not to enforce federal immigration laws without a specific request.  They also say they want to be open and welcoming to refugees.  My question today:  How will President Trump respond?  Will Cincinnati face economic or other sanctions, including, for example, funding of the Brent Spence Bridge, which he said he would fund when he was on the campaign trail? MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Courtis.  As I've noted before, at the end of the day, this order is about two things: one, keeping our cities safe, and two, respecting the hard-earned taxpayers who send their money to the federal government.  And the President is going to do everything he can within the scope of the executive order to make sure that cities who don’t comply with it -- counties and other institutions that remain sanctuary cities don’t get federal government funding in compliance with the executive order.  I think more areas like Miami-Dade, down in Florida, understand the importance of this order, and we hope cities like Cincinnati and other communities around the country follow their lead and comply with that. With that, Anita Kumar. Q    I have two questions.  The first one is, can you tell us who is paying or how this is happening with Prime Minister Abe’s visit to Mar-a-Lago?  Who will be paying for that?  I asked the White House yesterday.  They referred me to State.  State referred me to the Japanese government who didn’t respond.  It seems as if the Prime Minister was paying and the money was going to Treasury, as previously discussed before. MR. SPICER:  You mean when he travels here or to Florida? Q    Mar-a-Lago. MR. SPICER:  Okay. Q    Then it seems the White House would know that. MR. SPICER:  Yeah, and let me get back to you on that.  We’ll follow up with you on the exact financing.  I’m not sure how that flows, but I’d be glad to find out. Q    Okay.  Second question was, during the hearing yesterday that you talked about -- 9th Circuit -- there was some discussion about whether there needed to be a tweak to the executive order to make it clear that legal permanent residents would not be included in that, and there was some back and forth on that.  Will there be a tweak?   Q    I think there was further guidance that I spoke about that went out, I think it’s been a week ago -- correct me if I’m wrong -- and talked about, we wanted to make it very, very clear that legal permanent residents were not included in that.   But again, remember, we’re not talking about the merits of the order.  Right now, this discussion that happened last night and that the court will be ruling on is specific to the temporary restraining order and whether or not it should be maintained until there’s a further discussion on the merits. So again, I don’t want to get into the legal nuances, but right now the guidance is very clear that was issued several days ago, if not a week ago, that this is not about legal permanent residents.  So I just -- that they are excluded from this, and I don’t know why there would be that discussion.  That clarification has been made. Jeff. Q    Sean, you said you’re not talking about the merits of the order.  Was the President this morning talking about the merits of the order when he called it “disgraceful,” the hearing that he heard last night? MR. SPICER:  He wasn’t arguing before the 9th Circuit, Jeff.  Last night was a motion before the 9th Circuit on the temporary restraining order.  I think the President was very clear that U.S. code and the Constitution clearly give the President all the authority that is needed to make sure that he can regulate who comes into this country and prevent any acts of -- you know, anyone who is not coming to this country in a peaceful manner. The code, 8 U.S. Code 1152* [1182], is very, very clear on this.  And so I think the President was pointing out the same issue that we had in Boston, which is, once we had a chance to argue it on the merits, we won on it.  And so I think that’s what he’s -- he clearly did not argue in front of the 9th Circuit last night.  So -- Q    But he called it “disgraceful.”  By calling it “disgraceful,” is that the type of language that should be used between branches of government? MR. SPICER:  I think that the President, when you look at the U.S. code and how clear it’s written and the authority and power it gives the President to do what is necessary to keep this country safe and regulate who comes into this country, I think it’s a very, very clear reading, and the President was very -- I think he further went on and said, it doesn’t matter what level of education you’re at, I don’t think you could misread this. So I think -- Q    But isn’t that insulting an appointee to the federal bench? MR. SPICER:  I think he was very clear, Jeff.  So thank you.   Daniel Halper. Q    I was curious about the tweet that President Trump -- about his daughter’s brand, and then it was retweeted by the POTUS account.  What’s the standard that the President is doing in regards to his family businesses or that businesses -- MR. SPICER:  Well, I think this was less about his family business and an attack on his daughter.  He ran for President.  He won.  He’s leading this country.  And I think for people to take out their concern about his actions or his executive order on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success.   So, look, when it comes to his family, I think he’s been very clear how proud he is of what they do and what they’ve accomplished, and for someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is just -- is not acceptable, and the President has every right as a father to stand up for them. I'm going to go to Norma Garcia from KXTX. Q    Thank you.  In Texas there is a big push to penalize sanctuary cities.  In this state and other states around the country, there is a growing concern among undocumented immigrants whose lives are deeply rooted in the United States and have no criminal records.  My question is, is this administration ready to tackle comprehensive immigration reform?  If so, can you give us a timeline for it?  If not, what is the plan to deal with undocumented immigrants who live in this country long term? MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Norma.  I think this has come up several times.  I don't think that anybody doubts the President's concern or priority that is placed on immigration.  He has talked about it -- when you talk about a comprehensive approach, he has talked about building a wall, he's talked about making sure we go after criminals in this country, he's talked about walking through the process and addressing DACA and DAPA in time.  I think this is a big problem.  There is no question that both on the security side and on reforming the current immigration system that is so clearly broken, that he is walking through this already, both in terms of executive action and then will continue to work through Congress. So to your question about the timeline, I think he's already enacting several pieces of it and he's going to work with Congress to get further down that. Eamon Javers. Q    Sean -- MR. SPICER:  Hallie.  Q    Two here.  Playing off of questions from Daniel here, on the business activities that you describe the President taking offense to, Nordstrom has come out and says this was not a political decision, it was a business decision.  Ivanka Trump, as you know, has said she has divorced herself, separated herself from the business.  So how is she being treated unfairly if she's not part of -- MR. SPICER:  Well, I think there's clearly a targeting of her brand, and it's her name still out there.  So she's not directly running the company, it's still her name on it and there's clearly efforts to undermine that name based on her father's positions on particular policies that he's taken.  This is a direct attack on his policies and her name.  And so there is clearly an attempt for him to stand up for her because she is being maligned because they have a problem with his policies. John Roberts. Q    Sean, just a second -- actually, to clarify that, the timing of that tweet?  It looked like it was right after his PDB -- during?  Can you just --  MR. SPICER:  I've heard the conjecture.  He was free when that happened.  Thank you for asking. Q    Second question was on the lawsuit --  MR. SPICER:  No, that's two. Q    Oh, I'm sorry, that was a clarification of the one.  (Laughter.)   Q    Good, Hallie. Q    The President tweeted today that if he does not prevail in the court, talking about the lawsuit issue, that we will never be safe, we will never have the safety and security we're entitled to.  What does that mean?  Does that mean that this is the only tool in his toolbox and if this EO gets batted down by the courts, we're toast? MR. SPICER:  No.  But I think that when you -- and I mean, again, let's -- 8 U.S. Code 1182 says whenever the President finds that the entry of an alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation such periods as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of aliens or any class of aliens or immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens restrictions he may deem necessary and appropriate.   I guess at some point, if you don't look at that statute and say that the President has the power that Congress and the President have deemed necessary to keep this country safe, you've got to wonder how far you're going to allow that to get eroded. So the point is, is that at some area, you've got to wonder if the President isn't able to execute on the power that's been vested into him and is codified in U.S. code, at some point you have to wonder what else is at question.  We have a President that acted 100 percent lawfully to keep people out of this country from seven countries that we did not have the proper information to ensure they were coming into this country with the appropriate means and motives.  If at some point the President doesn't have the power, as given to him in law, to protect this country, I think that really questions what a slippery slope we're on. John. Q    Sean, two questions. MR. SPICER:  Of course.  (Laughter.)   Q    The President said this morning that he paid very close attention to the arguments before the 9th last night. MR. SPICER:  Yes. Q    But was he happy with the presentation that the DOJ attorney, August Flentje, made?  There was some concern by supporters of this extreme vetting program that he wasn’t strong enough.  He seemed to be searching for answers, particularly on the point of standing. MR. SPICER:  I think there was a lot of back and forth during that entire argument.  He made some solid points, and I think that he did what he had to represent the President’s case and to represent the administration’s case on the TRO. I think the President has really focused on the merits of this case, and looking forward to getting it back either to the 9th Circuit or to the lower court, or however it has to move.  He feels very confident on the merits, and that's where I think his focus has been.  So I don't -- I’m not concerned.  I think the President’s main concern has been on the merits of this case and making sure that an executive order that was lawfully executed and went through the entire process -- remember we've got to go back and remember that the DOJ’s Office of Legal Compliance vetted this order, deemed it was legal.  So we've followed the entire process to make sure that this was done correctly, constitutionally, legally, and every otherwise.  And so to now -- now our focus is making sure, whether or not we have to wait a day or two or whatever for the TRO, we look forward to the opportunity to discuss this on the merits. Jen Jacobs. Q    Whoa, whoa, whoa -- sorry.  Hold on.  Just as a point of clarification -- I’ve got a question --  MR. SPICER:  Now you're going with Halle's --  Q    So he is -- he was happy with his presentation --  MR. SPICER:  I think he is looking forward to the merits of this discussion.  That's where -- and I think he was pleased with some of the points that got made.  But his focus is on the merits of the order and making sure that ultimately we're able to do what we can to get this order back in place and protect the American people.   Jen. Q    The Muslim Brotherhood --  Q    Question two.   MR. SPICER:  Look at what Hallie started.  (Laughter.)   Q    We have reported that Russia has sent its biggest shipment of missiles ever to Syria.  Just wondering what the White House’s reaction is. MR. SPICER:  I think I'll have to -- we don't have any comment on this at this time. Jen. Q    The Muslim Brotherhood.  Is it accurate that the administration is weighing -- labeling the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization?  And will you do the same for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard? MR. SPICER:  I think there is no one that can question the President’s commitment to fully attacking and addressing the threat that we face by radical Islamic terrorism.  He has been -- made very clear during the campaign that the first step is understanding, knowing, and proclaiming who the enemy is.  And he’s going to do whatever it takes. That being said, I’m not going to get ahead of any announcements that we may or may not have coming in the near future.  But make no mistake, the President understands the threat that our nation faces, and he’s going to do everything he can to attack it, root it out, and destroy it. Cecilia. Q    Thank you.  The President also said today that in the last two weeks he’s learned a lot, and that terrorism is far greater -- and that terrorism is a far greater threat than people understand.  That sounds like he is telling the American public that they have something to fear.  Is there a specific threat that he is talking about?  And should the American public -- based on that statement right there -- be fearful? MR. SPICER:  No.  But I think the American people should understand that the President is committed to doing this.  We face a very, very real threat in ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism, and that we've got to do everything he can, and that the reason that he is taking the steps that he is, is because we must remain ever vigilant.  We can't let our guard down.  We have to be ahead of the curve.  And that the President is going to take the steps necessary to protect this country and its people.  And that the idea that we should sit back and not fully appreciate the constant threat that we're in, it’s week after week, month after month that we're hearing of another instance -- a lone wolf, et cetera, et cetera -- that is going throughout this country -- excuse me, throughout the world.  My apologies. And so I think what the President is doing is trying to make sure that the American people understand that he’s doing everything he can to protect them and to keep our institutions and our people safe.  And so this is not something that we can rest on our laurels, that we can't understand.  He was just down at CENTCOM and SOCOM Monday morning getting a full briefing of the threat that we face from around the world and their motives. And I think that that's something that he weighs very heavily on his mind when he meets with these people, gets these briefings, meets with the Green Beret soldiers, that he recognizes that there are so many people out there putting their life on the line to protect this country and to make sure that we understand the threats, and that it’s his job and his obligation to do everything within his power to take that information and do what he can to protect the country. And so just to put a pin in it, I just want to be clear.  While we may not face an imminent threat today, we don't know when that next threat comes.  Is it next week?  Is it next month?  Is it next year?  But the President wants to get ahead of the curve and make sure that we're not talking about what we should have done, but taking every step necessary to make sure that it doesn't happen.  Steve. Q    But is the threat today greater than it was yesterday or last week?  Because that's what he’s saying. MR. SPICER:  I understand what he’s saying.  What I’m telling you is, is that we shouldn’t ever be behind the curve on the threats this country faces.  We should make sure -- we don't know when the next one is coming.  We don't know when the next lone wolf is coming.  We don't know when the next attack is.  We've got amazing intelligence that's trying to root out and make sure that it doesn't happen again.  But what we can't do is wait for the next attack to come and say, I wish we had done the following.  And the steps that he's taken are proactively making this country and our people safer. Steve. Q    Sean, what was the White House response to the Republican proposal for a carbon tax floated today?  And separately, could you just set up tomorrow's meeting with the airline CEOs a little bit?  What do you hope to get out of it?  What do you hope to discuss? MR. SPICER:  So I'm not going to comment on pending legislation.  We'll wait to see where that comes.  That's just not going to be a habit of ours to comment on every bill that gets introduced or marked up in committee until we have a statement of administration policy.   And with respect to the meeting tomorrow, I'll have a further readout on that later tomorrow.  But I will say, in general, as you know, he's met with Intel just now.  He met with oil executives -- I mean, executives from the car manufacturers, manufacturing companies, technological companies, unions.  So these continued meetings that you'll see in the next months and years are going to be an attempt to make sure that he's sitting down with business leaders from around the country to figure out how he can use his office and this administration to further their ability to create jobs and grow the economy.  So this is going to be more of a pattern.  You're going to continue to see him meeting with people who want to share that agenda to grow, create jobs, manufacture here, lift wages up here, bring benefits to good-paying jobs, et cetera. Q    Should we take any significance from the fact that you did have this meeting about the carbon tax? MR. SPICER:  No.  I just -- look, we're not at a policy -- we have nothing to announce on that.   If I can go now to our next seat -- sorry -- we've got Josh Smith from WJHL in Southwest Virginia. Q    First off, thanks so much for taking questions from journalists covering local news.  We appreciate it.  WJHL is in Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia -- that is coal country.  And I have two questions relating to coal.  Then-candidate Trump came to Abingdon, Virginia last year and he made a bold promise -- if it helped to rescue the mining industry, that he would help to bring coal jobs and he would push back against environmental regulations.   If the executive order last week was a first step, what specifically is the President willing to do, planning to do to make good on that promise to help the coal industry, to encourage coal production and use, and to deal with what some call its demonized image?   And as a follow-up -- and I've got to ask two questions because when am I ever going to get to do this again?  What assurances can the President give those who hear him talking about him pushing back against environmental regulations and bringing back coal?  What assurances can he give those who are very worried about the impact on the environment? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think that there's this -- well, I think when you hear him talk about coal specifically, it's under the guise of clean coal.  And I think the technology that we're able to utilize these days make it one of the cleanest uses of technology that we have.  And the President's point is that as we bring back this industry, we can do it in a way that is environmentally friendly and it becomes a great and greater energy source for us. Just the other day, the Department of Energy noted that we expect I think it's about a 3 percent increase in coal production in this country, which is a noticeable reverse of where it's been in the past.  You mentioned the executive order and the talks that the President has had over the past year or so about his desire to bring back coal.   Largely, that has to do with regulation that the EPA has put on existing coal plants that have ensured that they couldn't operate in an effective way to stay open.  I think the President is working with industry to roll back a lot of that and do it in a way that's environmental-friendly.  And I think that you can do that utilizing the technology you have and harness the power of clean coal, Josh.  Thanks. Kristen. Q    Sean, Yemen has withdrawn permission for the United States to run special operations in ground missions against suspected terrorists in the wake of the recent raid there that claimed so many civilian lives.  Does that not undercut the administration's ability to fight terrorism in that region?  And do you stand by your assessment that it's a success? MR. SPICER:  Well, I'll take the last one first.  It's absolutely a success.  And I think anyone who would suggest it's not a success does disservice to the life of Chief Ryan Owens.  He fought knowing what was at stake in that mission.  And anybody who would suggest otherwise doesn't fully appreciate how successful that mission was, what the information that they were able to retrieve was, and how that will help prevent future terrorist attacks. Q    But even Senator John McCain --  MR. SPICER:  I understand that.  I think my statement is very clear on that, Kristen.  I think anybody who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and [does] a disservice to the life of Chief Owens. Q    Are you saying that Senator John McCain owes him an apology? MR. SPICER:  Hold on, Kristen, can I answer the question?  I'm answering the question.  Please let me finish.  The raid -- the action that was taken in Yemen was a huge success.  American lives will be saved because of it.  Future attacks will be prevented.  The life of Chief Ryan Owens was done in service to this country and we owe him and his family a great debt for the information that we received during that raid.  I think any suggestion otherwise is a disservice to his courageous life and the actions that he took.  Full stop.  I'm sorry, what was the first part? Q    Is that your message to Senator John McCain?  He's called it a failure. MR. SPICER:  That's my message to anybody who says that.  Anybody.  I just -- I don't know how much clearer I can be, Kristen. Hunter Walker. Q    Yes, thank you, Sean.  This morning, President Trump asked local law enforcement officials to help assist with deportations.  If he doesn't get the cooperation he's hoping for, does he plan to have DHS and CBP proactively begin deportations of undocumented criminals in the border zone? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think that when you talk about immigration and what he's doing -- whether it's the wall or enforcing existing regulations or visa reform -- I don't think anybody questions the President's commitment to border security and immigration reform.  In fact, it's usually quite the opposite.  So when it comes to the steps that he's going to take, I think I've addressed this multiple times what his priorities are going to be, but you've seen Secretary Kelly talk about construction of the wall, his implementation of the executive order to keep people out.  There is going to be a considerable amount of action on this front -- on immigration and border security.  It started day one and it's going to continue through the last possible day until the President feels that this border is 100 percent secure and we've got the immigration system completely under control. Q    Is defunding his only tool to get cooperation from the sanctuary cities? MR. SPICER:  Look, I'm not going to get ahead of it.  I think when you saw the support and some of the side conversations that the sheriffs and police officers had, and the conversations that we've had beyond that, the sheriffs the other day, the support that they've issued on behalf of his executive actions and his agenda as a whole -- these are the folks on the front lines in many cases, Hunter, that are on the border, that see what some of this does and how it affects families and businesses, not to mention the cost that it is to both our country, in terms of what we have to do to support the immigration at our southern border in particular, but also the cost that it has on our economy and on jobs. So you’re going to continue to see a flurry of activity, over and over and over again, to make sure that this President continues to show the importance that he puts on both border security and immigration reform. Q    Thank you, Sean.  Yesterday, on CNN, Kellyanne Conway announced that Prime Minister Trudeau is going to be here next week.  Can you confirm which day?  Have discussions on reviewing the Canadian part of NAFTA started?  And can you confirm that Sarah Palin is being considered as ambassador to Ottawa? MR. SPICER:  So I will have further updates on the Prime Minister’s schedule either later today or tomorrow.  I’m not in a position where I can finalize that.  But we will have --  Q    And all the other (inaudible) -- MR. SPICER:  Guys, slow your roll.  (Laughter.)  So we will -- with respect to the ambassador, we have no additional ambassador nominations or announcements to make on that front.  I’m sure, at some point, we will have soon. With respect to the agenda, as the President spoke with Prime Minister Trudeau a few weeks ago, they talked about trade and security and commerce, and I think all of that is going to be discussed at the time when the President and him further meet or discuss this. Q    And I wanted to follow up on that if you don’t mind.  Just on NATO, Canada, of course, is one of the 28 member countries.  The President has been calling out countries that pay their fair share of dues.  What are his options if countries don’t listen to him?  And what does this really mean? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think -- look, every country is obligated to pay two percent of their GDP, and the President has made it very clear that, for too long, many countries have been getting a free ride.  When he has talked to these countries, and as I’ve just read out, both Erdogan and Rajoy -- he has addressed this not just with them, but to so many of the other NATO countries.  And, by and large, every single one of them agrees with that.  They understand the importance of NATO, and the President is very clear that in order for NATO to be successful, these folks have to pay their fair share. Carol Lee.   Q    I want to follow on Kristen, and then I just have a question on Turkey.  Does the White House have a reaction to reports that Yemen has revoked permission for the U.S. to do ground missions there? MR. SPICER:  Yemen, more than most countries, fully appreciates the fight that we have with ISIS, and I think we’re going to continue to work with them to strengthen our diplomatic relationships and understand our fight against terrorism.  And so at this point, I’ll leave it at as that we understand that we share that commitment with them, and we’re going to continue to work with them to combat ISIS and to make sure that we do that.  I’m not in a position to go any further at this time. Q    President Erdogan said today that the U.S. agreed to work with Turkey to take Raqqa.  Can you clarify what the President said to him in that phone call? MR. SPICER:  I can’t.  I think the readout was as specific as we want to get with his conversation. Q    What's his characterization of the conversation? MR. SPICER:  I think the readout that we put out on Turkey was as far as we want to go with that.  Thank you. Hold on, I’m going to go to our last one, Adriana Cohen, a radio host and columnist for the Boston Herald. Q    Great to be with you, Sean.  Last night, Boston Mayor Walsh went on a television show to talk about sanctuary cities.  What does the President make of his vow to house illegal immigrants in Boston City Hall to shield them from the Trump administration? MR. SPICER:  I think the President’s executive order is pretty clear when it comes to these kind of actions.  Again, I referenced it earlier in the briefing, but it’s twofold.  One is, there’s a concern about the safety of the American people and how we let people come into this country, and second, with respect to the American taxpayer.  And if we’re going to be sending federal tax dollars to folks to Washington, I think they need to be used appropriately.  And the President is going to do everything in his power to respect the money that taxpayers send to Washington and is spent facilitating legal activities and on American citizens.   Blake. Q    Thanks, Sean.  Earlier today, the President said that the wall is in the process of being designed.  Given his previous background, is he or does he plan on being actively involved with the designing and the implementation of that wall?  And separately, last night, Elizabeth Warren -- any reaction from the White House on whether you believe what Mitch McConnell did was the correct thing?  Critics say she was silenced on the Senate floor. MR. SPICER:  On the wall, I mean, the President is a builder.  He understands and I think he’s going to make sure that as this project moves forward, that he’s going to stay in close touch with Secretary Kelly to make sure that it fits his specs.  But he takes enormous attention to detail, and he wants to make sure it gets done right.  So I would expect that a project of this magnitude and one that is this high on his priority list will get the necessary attention from the President. Q    And Senator Warren? MR. SPICER:  I’m sorry? Q    Senator Warren last night? MR. SPICER:  Yeah, look, I would refer you back to Senate rules.  I mean, this is not something that we tend to discuss here.  I’ll leave it to Senator McConnell and the Senate to discuss Senate rules. Q    I just wanted to follow up again on Yemen.  Just not sure exactly what you’re trying to say here.  I seems like the report was that the Yemeni government has asked the U.S. to stop doing any ground operations with regard to AQAP.  Is that the request that you got from the Yemeni government? MR. SPICER:  We'll have further information on that going forward.  I think we are in touch with Yemeni officials.  We’re working this through diplomatic channels.  But they understand the fight and the commitment that we both share when it comes to rooting out ISIS.  And I’ll have more information on that going forward. Q    So can I ask on the President’s tweet, Hallie had mentioned on part of it.  The other part of it this morning was that there’s been a big increase in traffic to the U.S. from certain areas.  Can you say what certain areas he’s referring to, and what data is he leaning on? MR. SPICER:  I’ll get back to you on that.  I’ve got to pull the data field on that.  Margaret. Q    Sean, two questions.  Turkey -- did the President dispatch the CIA director to Turkey as Turkish reports are saying right now? MR. SPICER:  I just saw the CIA director, so if it happened, it hasn’t happened in the last hour. Q    Okay.  The rest of that question was about -- this is part one -- about Gülen, whether there was discussion of extraditing Fetullah Gülen who Turkey views as a terrorist. MR. SPICER:  I have nothing further than the readout at this time.  Q    The second question, though, was about your statement -- ""We don’t know when the next lone wolf is coming.""  I believe, based on numbers, that the vast majority of lone-wolf attacks have been carried out by people who are either American, American-born, or naturalized American citizens.  So what specifically are you referring to there?  And what is he doing about those who are radicalized in front of their own computer screens? MR. SPICER:  Well, I guess my question, Margaret -- I mean, I think there’s at least -- just for example, within the seven countries that we’ve talked about, there’s at least 20-some odd people that, over the last few years, have come into this country and been convicted of or charged with acts of terrorism.  So the -- Q    But the people who are lone wolves and radicalized here. MR. SPICER:  I understand that.  But what I’m getting at is, you don’t know, I don’t know when is the next act, who’s going to commit it, how are they going to commit it.  The point is, is that you don’t look at odds and say, hey, let’s play the odds on American lives.  You do exactly what you can to present any attack from occurring.  And so I think you can go through any system and say, when was the last time that somebody committed a shoe bomb, and so let's not take shoes off.  The TSA -- Q    That's not what I'm asking. MR. SPICER:  No, I get what you're asking.  You're asking, when is the next terrorist attack, and we don’t know. Q    No, what is being done about people who are radicalized in the basement, in front of the computer screen, who are not affected by this ban. MR. SPICER:  Right.  And I think the President has asked both for a plan to defeat ISIS from stuff that is coming in from this, and he's taking steps but he's also looking at working with the FBI and domestic intelligence agencies to gather the best information we can to prevent acts on our soil from people, wherever they may be. Q    So something more is being done on that front that we haven’t heard about? MR. SPICER:  He has tasked the FBI.  It is a whole-of-government approach to what's going on.  We're not looking at this myopically and just saying, these are the seven countries.  The whole point of that first executive ban* [order], and I know that's not entirely what you're asking, was to start with countries that didn’t have the appropriate vetting measures to ensure that they could come into this country. As we move forward through this 90-day period, we're reviewing other countries, other options.  Those are the external threats coming into this country.  At the same time, the President has looked at options within the domestic intelligence gathering to figure out whether it's cyber or other ways that we can determine other ways to prevent or get ahead of additional threats that we might face in this country.  But it's not an either/or proposition.  It's a whole-of-government approach to what's going on. Q    A bipartisan group of senators are introducing legislation -- and I know you don’t like to talk about legislation -- that would allow the Senate to sign off on a reduction in sanctions against Russia.  Would the President support such a check by Congress on sanctions? MR. SPICER:  Well, there's two sets of sanctions, Tamara, that we got to deal with, right?  One is the ones with respect to Crimea.  And I think that Ambassador Haley has addressed that very forcefully at the U.N., that until Russia leaves Crimea, that those sanctions are a non-starter.  With respect to the other ones, I don’t want to get ahead of the legislation, if that's what that specifically is dealing with.  But again, we're not going to get into pending legislation.  With respect to the sanctions that specifically deal with Ukraine and Crimea, I think that Ambassador Haley has spoken very, very clearly about that.   Q    Sean, thanks.  The President said this morning in his address to the law enforcement officials, that he'll have a zero-tolerance policy for attacks against law enforcement officers.  As a specific policy proposal, what does that mean exactly?  More death penalty cases on the federal level?  What does he mean? MR. SPICER:  I think that what the President said not just yesterday with his meeting with the sheriffs, but then today, is that he wants them to understand that he is a true friend -- they have a true friend in the White House, somebody who understands the dangers that they face every day by putting their lives on the line to protect the American people, whether it's pulling someone up for a traffic stop and not knowing what's in the car, or going up to a house to serve a warrant and not knowing who's behind that door.  These men and women, every day, day in and day out, are willing to put their lives on the line and make huge sacrifices.   So he wants them to know that they have a true friend here in the White House that's going to have their back.  How that manifests itself going forward, I think the President will have further details as that moves forward.  But for right now, I think his number-one message to them was:  You've got a friend, he's got your back, let's do what we can to get these cities.   I think the other thing that was important is that, you know, he mentioned Chicago.  Their crime rate -- their murder rate is up 45, 50 percent.  And in so many of these cities it's up.  It's unacceptable.  And I think the President is disgusted that so many American lives are taken, injured, whatever -- that we can't walk down the streets of our own cities in safety.  And I think he wants to make sure that they understand his commitment not just to preventing acts of terrorism from coming into this country, but also that whether it's gang violence or whatever, that people feel safe and that law enforcement is empowered to do what it can to keep our community safe, to work with communities, to establish policies that both respect our citizens but do so in a way that makes them feel safe and allows them to drive and walk down the streets of our city. Charlie. Q    Journalist Matt Drudge tweeted today that the Republican Party should be sued for fraud, basically upset about the lack of any legislation to repeal Obamacare or any tax cut legislation.  So what's your message to him and anyone else who's worried about sort of the big push in the beginning and who might be concerned that that momentum is stalling? MR. SPICER:  I think it's hardly stalling.  I think it's a mammoth thing to repeal and replace.  I think there's no question the President's commitment to doing this.  You've heard Speaker Ryan talk about how we should be able to have this wrapped up by the end of the year.  It's a big bill.  It got jammed through, and it was very sweeping.  We're talking about one-fifth of our economy.  We can either do it quickly, as the Democrats did, and end up with a monstrosity where premiums go up, access is limited, or we can do it right.   And I think the President, while he wants to get this done as soon as possible and understand what's at stake, he wants to do it right.  He understands how important health care is to American families and individuals.  And so his goal is to get it done right and have an outcome that achieves the goals that it sets out to do.  That's it -- plain and simple. April. Q    Sean, I have a series of questions.   MR. SPICER:  Look what you started, Hallie Jackson.  (Laughter.)   Q    Don't blame it on Hallie, okay?   Going back to the issue of policing, what happens when there is a situation -- you're talking about good policing -- but what happens when there are situations that we've seen over the last few years that have been highlighted with this accountability piece with cameras?  What happens when there is bad policing?  What does this President -- MR. SPICER:  Then we have to deal with it.  I don't -- I think the President wants to do what he can.  But again, I think you're right, we've got to have good policing.  But that's -- he wants to stand with them, talk about how we can do proper training, what kind of funding they need to do their job better.  In so many cases, the policy are asking for the resources because they've become fearful of making routine stops by preventing it.   So I think it’s working with the police, integrating those kind of back and forth and having a dialogue in communities to make sure that we're doing it, as you put it, in a way that instills confidence in our citizens and our communities.  But we can do this right.  And we can make sure -- Q    So it’s not an either/or, though? MR. SPICER:  No, absolutely no.  Q    Okay. MR. SPICER:  No, no, no.  We've got to do this -- look, police officers from around this country on a daily basis put their lives out there, and I think that they want to keep communities safe.  Like teachers, they enter this not -- no cop signs up, or sheriff, because of the money.  Like teachers, they do it because they care about the community.  They care about making this country better, their community better.  But I think, in return, they should be provided the resources and the policies they need to do their job well and to do so that ensures that we have this back-and-forth dialogue with the American people that continues to earn the respect that they deserve for the sacrifice they're making. Q    All right, the next question.   MR. SPICER:  How many have we got?  Just so I -- Q    Maybe three -- maybe three more.  (Laughter.)  It’s Black History Month.  Let me go.  (Laughter.)   MR. SPICER:  You can play that once.  (Laughter.)   Q    I got a couple more days.   MR. SPICER:  Okay.  (Laughter.)  Q    All right, so listen, on the issue of last evening with Elizabeth Warren.  Coretta Scott King -- I want to get your reaction to these words that they're not allowed:  “Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge.”  And she’s basically saying that Sessions has indifference towards criminal violations of civil rights laws.  What do you say to that? MR. SPICER:  Well, obviously, we have a lot of respect for her and the sacrifices that she made, and the sacrifices that, frankly, she endured in her life.  But I would respectfully disagree with her assessment of Senator Session then and now. His records on civil voting rights I think is outstanding.  And like Arlen Specter, the late Arlen Specter, I can only hope that if she was still with us today, that after getting to know him and to see his record and his commitment to voting civil rights, that she would share the same view that Senator Specter did where he said, “Although I voted against him, getting to know the man that is now, I regret that vote.”  And I would hope that if she was still with us today that she would share that sentiment.   Because Senator Sessions’s records both as U.S. attorney for Alabama, as attorney general, and as senator has been one that has stood up for voting rights.  He prosecuted the Klan.  He stood up for Coretta Scott King getting -- for getting the gold medal.  He has been a tireless advocate of voting and civil rights throughout his career.  And I would just hope that if she was still with us today, that she would share the sentiments of former Senator Specter. Q    Okay, and last two.  On diversity here, the administration’s diversity issues, you've been slammed on that recently.  I understand that there’s been a meeting.  Vice President Pence has been talking to J.C. Watts, Michael Steele and others -- if you can elaborate on that.  And also there’s a lot of groundswell about this HBCU executive order.  What’s going on with that?  MR. SPICER:  So the HBCU presidents will be in town later this month as part of a national celebration.  We’ll have further updates on both the meetings that we may have with them, the activities surrounding that, in terms of the administration.  And then I think we’ll have further updates on it, as I mentioned with all executive orders.  We have nothing to update on that. But obviously, the President has a strong commitment to them and understands over the last eight years they've been woefully neglected.  And I think he wants to really show a commitment in funding to HBCUs.  And so you’ll see I think not just a push this month, but in his budget and going forward. Q    PLUS loans, Pell grants?  MR. SPICER:  I think his budget will address a lot of these issues, April. Q    The diversity piece, the diversity piece. MR. SPICER:  And I think -- look, we're going to continue to reach out to a lot of folks to get their ideas and their input.  I think he’s shown that both through the transition and now.  But we're going to continue to reach out to people of different backgrounds, of different color, of different gender, of different economic -- socioeconomic, of different industry, of different parties.  The President I think continues to show a desire to reach out and talk to people who I think share an agenda of moving the country forward and doesn't really care about their background, their voting history, any of those other ideological traits.  If they share a commitment to moving this country forward and lifting people up, that's his end of -- Q    Sean --  Q    You mentioned the ""one in, two out"" order in your opening.  There was a lawsuit filed in federal court this morning challenging that lawsuit.  Is the White House aware of that?  MR. SPICER:  Yes. Q    And what’s your response to it? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think the lawsuit presumes a lot of outcomes that are widely inaccurate.  I think that it presumes that certain things would be part of the ""one out."" The bottom line is, is that overregulation has stemmed economic growth and job creation.  Reviewing those to make sure that they are meeting their intent and not stifling job creation at the expense of whatever they were intended to do is something that should be smart and welcome by everybody.   The idea that we're willy-nilly just allowing regulations to occur, but the lawsuit specifically, is wildly inaccurate.  It makes a ton of assumptions that call for speculation on what may or may not happen in the future.  And that's highly -- it's just subjective at best and doesn't have any basis in fact. Thank you, guys.  Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.  Q    More hands up here, Sean. MR. SPICER:  I know, I'll see them tomorrow.  END 2:38 P.M.

Grant. She served as First Lady of from 1869 to 1877. Quite naturally, shy young Lieutenant Grant lost his heart to friendly Julia; and made his love known, as he said himself years later, ""in the most awkward manner imaginable."" She told her side of the story--her father opposed the match, saying, ""the boy is too poor,"" and she answered angrily that she was poor herself. The ""poverty"" on her part came from a slave-owner's lack of ready cash. Daughter of Frederick and Ellen Wrenshall Dent, Julia had grown up on a plantation near St. Louis in a typically Southern atmosphere. In memoirs prepared late in life--unpublished until 1975--she pictured her girlhood as an idyll: ""one long summer of sunshine, flowers, and smiles…"" She attended the Misses Mauros' boarding school in St. Louis for seven years among the daughters of other affluent parents. A social favorite in that circle, she met ""Ulys"" at her home, where her family welcomed him as a West Point classmate of her brother Frederick; soon she felt lonely without him, dreamed of him, and agreed to wear his West Point ring. Julia and her handsome lieutenant became engaged in 1844, but the Mexican War deferred the wedding for four long years. Their marriage, often tried by adversity, met every test; they gave each other a life-long loyalty. Like other army wives,""dearest Julia"" accompanied her husband to military posts, to pass uneventful days at distant garrisons. Then she returned to his parents' home in 1852 when he was ordered to the West. Ending that separation, Grant resigned his commission two years later. Farming and business ventures at St. Louis failed, and in 1860 he took his family--four children now--back to his home in Galena, Illinois. He was working in his father's leather goods store when the Civil War called him to a soldier's duty with his state's volunteers. Throughout the war, Julia joined her husband near the scene of action whenever she could. After so many years of hardship and stress, she rejoiced in his fame as a victorious general, and she entered the White House in 1869 to begin, in her words, ""the happiest period"" of her life. With Cabinet wives as her allies, she entertained extensively and lavishly. Contemporaries noted her finery, jewels and silks and laces. Upon leaving the White House in 1877, the Grants made a trip around the world that became a journey of triumphs. Julia proudly recalled details of hospitality and magnificent gifts they received. But in 1884 Grant suffered yet another business failure and they lost all they had. To provide for his wife, Grant wrote his famous personal memoirs, racing with time and death from cancer. The means thus afforded and her widow's pension enabled her to live in comfort, surrounded by children and grandchildren, till her own death in 1902. She had attended in 1897 the dedication of Grant's monumental tomb in New York City where she was laid to rest. She had ended her own chronicle of their years together with a firm declaration: ""the light of his glorious fame still reaches out to me, falls upon me, and warms me.""

One of nine children of a Presbyterian minister, Cleveland was born in New Jersey in 1837. He was raised in upstate New York. As a lawyer in Buffalo, he became notable for his single-minded concentration upon whatever task faced him. At 44, he emerged into a political prominence that carried him to the White House in three years. Running as a reformer, he was elected Mayor of Buffalo in 1881, and later, Governor of New York. Cleveland won the Presidency with the combined support of Democrats and reform Republicans, the ""Mugwumps,"" who disliked the record of his opponent James G. Blaine of Maine. A bachelor, Cleveland was ill at ease at first with all the comforts of the White House. ""I must go to dinner,"" he wrote a friend, ""but I wish it was to eat a pickled herring a Swiss cheese and a chop at Louis' instead of the French stuff I shall find."" In June 1886 Cleveland married 21-year-old Frances Folsom; he was the only President married in the White House. Cleveland vigorously pursued a policy barring special favors to any economic group. Vetoing a bill to appropriate $10,000 to distribute seed grain among drought-stricken farmers in Texas, he wrote: ""Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the Government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character. . . . "" He also vetoed many private pension bills to Civil War veterans whose claims were fraudulent. When Congress, pressured by the Grand Army of the Republic, passed a bill granting pensions for disabilities not caused by military service, Cleveland vetoed it, too. He angered the railroads by ordering an investigation of western lands they held by Government grant. He forced them to return 81,000,000 acres. He also signed the Interstate Commerce Act, the first law attempting Federal regulation of the railroads. In December 1887 he called on Congress to reduce high protective tariffs. Told that he had given Republicans an effective issue for the campaign of 1888, he retorted, ""What is the use of being elected or re-elected unless you stand for something?"" But Cleveland was defeated in 1888; although he won a larger popular majority than the Republican candidate Benjamin Harrison, he received fewer electoral votes. Elected again in 1892, Cleveland faced an acute depression. He dealt directly with the Treasury crisis rather than with business failures, farm mortgage foreclosures, and unemployment. He obtained repeal of the mildly inflationary Sherman Silver Purchase Act and, with the aid of Wall Street, maintained the Treasury's gold reserve. When railroad strikers in Chicago violated an injunction, Cleveland sent Federal troops to enforce it. ""If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a post card in Chicago,"" he thundered, ""that card will be delivered."" Cleveland's blunt treatment of the railroad strikers stirred the pride of many Americans. So did the vigorous way in which he forced Great Britain to accept arbitration of a disputed boundary in Venezuela. But his policies during the depression were generally unpopular. His party deserted him and nominated William Jennings Bryan in 1896. After leaving the White House, Cleveland lived in retirement in Princeton, New Jersey. He died in 1908.

Harding Warren G. Harding, an Ohio Republican, was the 29th President of the United States (1921-1923). Though his term in office was fraught with scandal, including Teapot Dome, Harding embraced technology and was sensitive to the plights of minorities and women. Before his nomination, Warren G. Harding declared, ""America's present need is not heroics, but healing; not nostrums, but normalcy; not revolution, but restoration; not agitation, but adjustment; not surgery, but serenity; not the dramatic, but the dispassionate; not experiment, but equipoise; not submergence in internationality, but sustainment in triumphant nationality...."" A Democratic leader, William Gibbs McAdoo, called Harding's speeches ""an army of pompous phrases moving across the landscape in search of an idea."" Their very murkiness was effective, since Harding's pronouncements remained unclear on the League of Nations, in contrast to the impassioned crusade of the Democratic candidates, Governor James M. Cox of Ohio and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Thirty-one distinguished Republicans had signed a manifesto assuring voters that a vote for Harding was a vote for the League. But Harding interpreted his election as a mandate to stay out of the League of Nations. Harding, born near Marion, Ohio, in 1865, became the publisher of a newspaper. He married a divorcee, Mrs. Florence Kling De Wolfe. He was a trustee of the Trinity Baptist Church, a director of almost every important business, and a leader in fraternal organizations and charitable enterprises. He organized the Citizen's Cornet Band, available for both Republican and Democratic rallies; ""I played every instrument but the slide trombone and the E-flat cornet,"" he once remarked. Harding's undeviating Republicanism and vibrant speaking voice, plus his willingness to let the machine bosses set policies, led him far in Ohio politics. He served in the state Senate and as Lieutenant Governor, and unsuccessfully ran for Governor. He delivered the nominating address for President Taft at the 1912 Republican Convention. In 1914 he was elected to the Senate, which he found ""a very pleasant place."" An Ohio admirer, Harry Daugherty, began to promote Harding for the 1920 Republican nomination because, he later explained, ""He looked like a President."" Thus a group of Senators, taking control of the 1920 Republican Convention when the principal candidates deadlocked, turned to Harding. He won the Presidential election by an unprecedented landslide of 60 percent of the popular vote. Republicans in Congress easily got the President's signature on their bills. They eliminated wartime controls and slashed taxes, established a Federal budget system, restored the high protective tariff, and imposed tight limitations upon immigration. By 1923 the postwar depression seemed to be giving way to a new surge of prosperity, and newspapers hailed Harding as a wise statesman carrying out his campaign promise--""Less government in business and more business in government."" Behind the facade, not all of Harding's Administration was so impressive. Word began to reach the President that some of his friends were using their official positions for their own enrichment. Alarmed, he complained, ""My...friends...they're the ones that keep me walking the floors nights!"" Looking wan and depressed, Harding journeyed westward in the summer of 1923, taking with him his upright Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover. ""If you knew of a great scandal in our administration,"" he asked Hoover, ""would you for the good of the country and the party expose it publicly or would you bury it?"" Hoover urged publishing it, but Harding feared the political repercussions. He did not live to find out how the public would react to the scandals of his administration. In August of 1923, he died in San Francisco of a heart attack.

What type of individual is the program seeking to find? The President's Commission on White House Fellowships is looking for individuals who are most likely to fulfill the mission of the White House Fellows Program. Selection as a White House Fellow is based on a combination of the following criteria: A record of remarkable professional achievement early in one's career. Evidence of leadership skills and the potential for further growth. A demonstrated commitment to public service. The skills to succeed at the highest levels of the Federal government, and the ability to work effectively as part of a team. We also look for individuals with exceptional writing ability, a positive attitude, strong management skills, and the ability to work well with others. All these qualities combined with the strength of one's character are taken into consideration when selecting a class of White House Fellows. 2. What is the experience of a White House Fellow during the program year? Being a White House Fellow is an honor, a privilege, and a full-time commitment. Fellows are expected to fully engage in their work placement, which lies at the heart of a White House Fellowship. Work placements can offer unparalleled experience working with Cabinet and White House officials on challenging issues. The work often requires long hours and, at times, may also require travel on behalf of the agency. The Education Program augments and enhances the work experience. Over the course of the year, Fellows are expected to fully participate in the Education Program, which includes semi-weekly speaker seminars and, when possible, domestic policy trips, an international policy trip, and day trips to study various policy issues. In addition to their work placement and Education Program, the Fellows also participate in community service projects during their year in Washington, D.C. Application and Eligibility 3. How do I apply? Applicants should apply online by visiting the ""Apply"" section of the White House Fellows website. Applications must be submitted online by January 11, 2017 at 5:59 PM (EST). It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that his/her application has been transmitted in its entirety. 4. What is the selection process like? Do you have a Calendar? A description of the Selection Process along with a calendar is available on the White House Fellows website http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/fellows/process. 5. What are the eligibility requirements? Applicants must be U.S. citizens. Applicants must have completed their undergraduate education and be working in their chosen professions. Individuals currently employed by the Federal government are not eligible to apply with the exception of career military personnel. If you have a question about your status as a Federal employee, please call the White House Fellows Program office at (202) 395-4522. 6. I have previously worked for the Federal government, am I eligible to apply? Yes. 7. What types of people are selected as Fellows? Selection as a White House Fellow is based on a combination of the following criteria: A record of remarkable professional achievement early in one's career. Evidence of leadership skills and the potential for further growth. A demonstrated commitment to public service. The skills to succeed at the highest levels of the Federal government, and the ability to work effectively as part of a team. Please refer to the bios of the current class of Fellows to learn about their backgrounds https://www.whitehouse.gov/participate/fellows/2016-2017. 8. Can I be a White House Fellow if I have dual citizenship? In order to get the proper security clearance for the Fellowship, it is likely that individuals with dual citizenship would need to give up any non-U.S. citizenship(s). 9. Are there age restrictions? There are no age restrictions. However, the Fellowship program was created to give selected Americans the experience of government service early in their careers. 10. Does a candidate need to be of the same political party as the current Administration? No. The Commission awards fellowships strictly on a non-partisan basis. 11. If selected, can I continue to participate in organizations in which I currently serve -- such as corporate and government boards, or on state or local councils? White House Fellows are full-time employees of the United States government and are subject to the ethics laws and Standards of Ethical Conduct for employees of the Executive Branch. These standards prohibit Fellows from receiving any salary or any contribution to or supplementation of salary from any source other than the United States government. If outside activity that is uncompensated conflicts with your official duties, then you will not be able to continue that outside activity. 12. Are applicants required to submit financial disclosures if selected? What happens if there is a conflict of interest with my investments and my assignment? Certain placements, such as in the White House, will require that a Financial disclosure form be submitted. Conflict of interest matters that arise will be handled on a case-by-case basis according to all applicable laws and regulations. If you have questions during the application process about potential conflicts of interest, please contact the White House Fellows Program office to inquire. 13. Are applicants required to undergo a security and background investigation? Yes. Regional Finalists are required to submit comprehensive background information, as Fellows must be qualified to pass a top secret security clearance. Once this information is submitted, background investigations will commence. Please be assured that all of this information is carefully protected and kept confidential. Panelists and Commissioners do not have access to background investigation information. Information provided by candidates who ultimately are not selected will be destroyed. Selection 14. How is a class of Fellows selected? The selection process is very competitive. The White House Fellows Program office processes the applications and former Fellows screen the applications to identify the most promising candidates. The most qualified applicants are selected to be interviewed by eight to ten regional panels, which are comprised of prominent local citizens. Based on the results of the interviews, approximately thirty candidates proceed as National Finalists. The President's Commission on White House Fellowships then interviews the thirty candidates and recommends 11-19 outstanding candidates to the President for a one-year appointment as Fellows. Those who are appointed as White House Fellows must return to Washington, DC to participate in Placement Week. To learn more in-depth information about the selection process, please visit the Selection Process and Calendar page. 15. What is the best approach to prepare for interviews? The interviews are competitive. We recommend that Regional and National Finalists carefully prepare as they would for any other type of interview. We also recommend that Finalists: Know their application well, as each application is carefully studied. Study current events. One of the essential qualities of a White House Fellows is that they are citizens of the larger world. Be current on key issues in your professional field. Develop a clear articulation about why you should be selected. Placement 16. What is Placement Week and how is placement determined? The individuals who are appointed by the President to serve as White House Fellows will be required to come to Washington, DC in July to participate in a series of briefings and interviews to determine their fellowship work placements. The Commission pays for travel and lodging during Placement Week. Administration 17. Will Fellows continue to serve in their placements in the new Administration?  Yes, the 2016-2017 class of White House Fellows will continue to serve in their placements through the transition to a new presidential administration. We are proud that the White House Fellows program has remained constant over the course of ten administrations.  18. Are Fellows provided with compensation and benefits -- such as salary and health insurance -- during the program year? Fellows are considered Federal employees, and receive a competitive salary during their one year fellowship. Military personnel, however, maintain their current salary and benefits. Fellows are also eligible to purchase health insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plans available at their agencies. Details about the health plans available can be viewed on the Office of Personnel Management website at http://www.opm.gov. 19. Does the fellowship provide housing during the Fellowship year? No. Fellows are responsible for their housing arrangements. Applicants should be aware that Fellows cannot accept subsidized housing gifts from former employers or other sources. 20. Can Fellows receive outside income from other sources -- private or public -- during the program year? White House Fellows are considered full-time employees of the United States government and are subject to the ethics laws and Standards of Ethical Conduct for employees of the Executive Branch. These standards prohibit Fellows from receiving salary, contributions, or supplementation of salary from any source other than the United States government. Fellows cannot continue any outside activity that conflicts with official duties. Service on advisory boards and other types of committees are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if a Fellow can continue the activity based on the precise nature of the activity and the official duties while serving as an employee of the United States government in the program. 21. How are special needs -- such as disabilities -- for Fellows handled? The program staff is available to work one-on-one with individuals to properly handle any special needs. 22. How are previously scheduled commitments -- such as a vacation -- handled during the program year? The program year is a full-time commitment, with work, education, travel, and fellowship responsibilities. Almost all activities are mandatory. Only under special circumstances, and with approval by the Program Director, are Fellows excused from activities. If this is a year when you have a multitude of personal commitments, vacations, or issues, we strongly encourage applicants to reconsider the timing of their application. Each Fellow and the entire class are most effective with full participation and engagement. It is unfair to others to accept the fellowship and then not fully participate. 23. Where can I direct additional questions? The program staff is available to provide assistance and answer questions. The staff can be reached at (202) 395-4522. They may also be reached by email at whitehousefellows@whf.eop.gov.   Return to Top   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

Work assignments can offer unparalleled experience working with senior administration officials on ever changing issues and challenges. This work often requires long hours and, at times, unglamorous duties that require as much perseverance as ability on the Fellows' part. White House Fellows typically spend a year as full-time, paid assistants to senior White House Staff, the Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries and other top-ranking government officials. Their assignments demand a capacity for quick learning and a willingness to work hard, often on issues outside of their area of expertise. Responsibilities range from chairing interagency meetings and designing and implementing federal policies, to drafting speeches for cabinet secretaries to representing their agencies on Capitol Hill and in international treaty negotiations. Job assignments are made by the Director of the President's Commission on White House Fellowships in consultation with agency officials on the basis of interviews conducted during ""Placement Week"". Fellows receive a salary and benefits from the agency for which they work. White House Fellows cannot receive compensation from any other source during their year of government service. In return for the privilege of participating in the Fellowship year, Fellows are expected to apply what they have learned by contributing to the nation as greater leaders in their respective communities, professions, and in public service. Fellows are expected to return to their former or new occupations more experienced in public policy decision-making and better prepared to contribute to national affairs, thereby fulfilling the mission of the program. Education Program The Education Program augments and enhances the work placement experience. Fellows are expected to fully participate in the Education Program, which includes weekly speaker seminars, domestic policy trips, an international policy trip, and day trips to study various policy issues. The Education Program serves as an important aspect of the Fellowship experience, and increases the Fellows’ exposure to renowned leaders from the private and public sectors. Each class meets with dozens of individuals including Supreme Court Justices, Cabinet Secretaries, senior White House officials, Members of Congress, military leaders, journalists, historians, business executives, leaders from non-government organizations, and foreign heads of state. These sessions generally take place during the week, and are off-the-record, lively and frank. Another component of the Education Program involves the study of U.S. policy in action across the country and abroad, during several policy study trips throughout the year. White House Fellows have traveled throughout the United States, most recently to New York City, Seattle, Chicago and Detroit to study a range of issues such as education, homeland security and transportation, energy, economic development, local governance, and health care. Fellows have also had the opportunity to travel internationally. Fellows have traveled to Turkey, Poland, and Russia to study emerging democracies and international security. Fellows have also traveled to South Africa and Botswana to learn about the African Growth and Opportunity Act and HIV/AIDS issues. And Fellows have studied human rights issues in China and Vietnam, and have traveled to India and Pakistan to study nuclear policies and the issues surrounding the disputed Kashmir territory. Throughout the year, Fellows have several opportunities to engage with the U.S. military to broaden their understanding of military service. Fellows have visited the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, where they traveled by helicopter and by Assault Amphibian Vehicles to view a Platoon live fire exercise of Cobra SIMCAS followed by a lunch of Meals-Ready-to-Eat. Fellows have also landed on aircraft carriers at sea and have flown on a KC-135 while observing an aerial refueling of an F-16 Fighting Falcon. Community Service Community service is a key component of the White House Fellows program. Fellows have a strong legacy of service to their communities and participate in community service projects throughout their year in Washington, D.C.  Fellows have helped build homes with Habitat for Humanity, mentored high school students, assisted WWII veterans at local events, participated in the clean-up of local schools, and tutored young students before school. Fellowship Perhaps the most enriching component of the program is class fellowship, which often results in enduring friendships. Alumni convene at yearly meetings in Washington, D.C., and eagerly welcome new Fellows into one of the most prestigious networks of professionals and leaders in the nation. Alumni In return for the Fellowship year, President Johnson expected the Fellows to ""repay that privilege"" when they left by ""continuing to work as private citizens on their public agendas."" He hoped that the Fellows would contribute to the Nation as future leaders. This vision holds true today. White House Fellows have a responsibility to give back to the Nation in the same way, in return for the training and experiences provided during their Fellowship year. The White House Fellows Foundation & Association, established in 1969, serves as an alumni group for all former White House Fellows. The Foundation & Association encourages and facilitates alumni contribution to public service and furthers the mission of the Fellowship program. Following the Fellowship year, participation in the Association is an ongoing commitment of the more than 700 alumni.

Eisenhower, and a very popular First Lady of the United States from 1953 to 1961. Mamie Eisenhower's bangs and sparkling blue eyes were as much trademarks of an administration as the President's famous grin. Her outgoing manner, her feminine love of pretty clothes and jewelry, and her obvious pride in husband and home made her a very popular First Lady. Born in Boone, Iowa, Mamie Geneva Doud moved with her family to Colorado when she was seven. Her father retired from business, and Mamie and her three sisters grew up in a large house in Denver. During winters the family made long visits to relatives in the milder climate of San Antonio, Texas. There, in 1915, at Fort Sam Houston, Mamie met Dwight D. Eisenhower, a young second lieutenant on his first tour of duty. She drew his attention instantly, he recalled: ""a vivacious and attractive girl, smaller than average, saucy in the look about her face and in her whole attitude."" On St. Valentine's Day in 1916 he gave her a miniature of his West Point class ring to seal a formal engagement; they were married at the Doud home in Denver on July 1. For years Mamie Eisenhower's life followed the pattern of other Army wives: a succession of posts in the United States, in the Panama Canal Zone; duty in France, in the Philippines. She once estimated that in 37 years she had unpacked her household at least 27 times. Each move meant another step in the career ladder for her husband, with increasing responsibilities for her. The first son Doud Dwight or ""Icky,"" who was born in 1917, died of scarlet fever in 1921. A second child, John, was born in 1922 in Denver. Like his father he had a career in the army; later he became an author and served as ambassador to Belgium. During World War II, while promotion and fame came to ""Ike,"" his wife lived in Washington. After he became president of Columbia University in 1948, the Eisenhowers purchased a farm at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It was the first home they had ever owned. His duties as commander of North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces--and hers as his hostess at a chateau near Paris--delayed work on their dream home, finally completed in 1955. They celebrated with a housewarming picnic for the staff from their last temporary quarters: the White House. When Eisenhower had campaigned for President, his wife cheerfully shared his travels; when he was inaugurated in 1953, the American people warmly welcomed her as First Lady. Diplomacy--and air travel--in the postwar world brought changes in their official hospitality. The Eisenhowers entertained an unprecedented number of heads of state and leaders of foreign governments, and Mamie's evident enjoyment of her role endeared her to her guests and to the public. In 1961 the Eisenhowers returned to Gettysburg for eight years of contented retirement together. After her husband's death in 1969, Mamie continued to live on the farm, devoting more of her time to her family and friends. Mamie Eisenhower died on November 1, 1979. She is buried beside her husband in a small chapel on the grounds of the Eisenhower Library in Abilene, Kansas.

Brady Press Briefing Room  12:37 P.M. EST MR. SPICER:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Happy Friday.  It's another busy day here at the White House and across the Trump administration.   The first jobs report under the President's administration was released this morning.  It's National Wear Red Day, highlighting the importance of preventing heart disease.  It's National Catholic Schools Week.  And the President is going to be signing some executive orders, delivering some much-needed regulatory relief to lenders and borrowers in the next few minutes. We're finishing up the second week here really strong.  Yesterday, another great deal was reached with Lockheed Martin for the purchase of a new lot of F35s.  Through the President’s intervention, a total of 90 planes -- for a lot of 90 planes; 55 were purchased for U.S. military that added up to a total of $455 million savings for U.S. taxpayers from the previous lot, with an average cost reduction of 7.5 percent, another big win that the President has delivered on for U.S. taxpayers. Speaking of good numbers, let’s turn to the jobs report.  The economy added more than 227,000 new jobs, significantly more than the 175,000 that had been expected.  Today’s report reflects the consumer confidence that the Trump presidency has inspired.  According to a recent Gallup poll, economic confidence is at a new high, and ADP showed strong private sector hiring.  President Trump campaigned on how to make America work again.  Even before he took office, the markets knew he would deliver on that promise.  The President has already taken significant steps to turn our economy around, and he’s looking forward to ensuring that every American who wants a job has the opportunity to find one. While the President is definitely pleased that the job growth has far surpassed expectations and that the labor force participation is rising, he also recognizes that there’s a lot more work to be done.  The President has a big and bold agenda to grow the U.S. economy and to create jobs.  In just his first two weeks in office, he’s met with more than 50 business leaders across a vast range of industries.  This morning, the President participated in a strategic and policy forum with business leaders from some of our country’s most successful companies.  The President understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders on how to make the nation’s economy stronger.  His firsthand experience as a successful businessman helps to guide his decisions as President, and he will continue to seek opinions of other job creators while crafting an economic agenda. All of these meetings are focused on one primary goal: providing new and improved employment opportunities for all Americans.  We’re looking at a full range of policy measures to achieve that goal: regulatory relief, tax and trade reform, empowering women in the workplace, rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure, and improving our education system.   Also today, in pursuit of that goal, the President will be signing two executive actions as part of his plan to overhaul our financial and regulatory system.  I expect that to happen closer to the one o'clock hour.  The first is an executive order for posing guideline principles that sets the table for a regulatory system that mitigates risk, encourages growth, and more importantly, protects consumers.   The Dodd-Frank Act is a disastrous policy that’s hindering our markets, reducing the availability of credit, and crippling our economy’s ability to grow and create jobs.  It imposed hundreds of new regulations on financial institutions while establishing unaccountable and unconstitutional new agency that does not adequately protect consumers.  Perhaps worst of all, despite all of its overreaching, Dodd-Frank did not address the causes of the financial crisis, something we all know must be done.  It did not solve the ""too big to fail,"" and we must determine conclusively that the failure of a large bank will never again leave taxpayers on the hook. The presidential memorandum addresses the burdens of government regulations and the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule.  The rule is a solution in search of a problem.  There are better ways to protect investors, and the Trump administration is taking action to do so.  We’re directing the Department of Labor to review this rule.  The rule’s intent may be to have provided retirees and others with better financial advice, but in reality, its effect has been to limit the financial services that are available to them.  President Trump does not intend to put unnecessary limits on economic opportunity.  The Department of Labor exceeded its authority with this rule, and this is exactly the kind of government regulatory overreach the President was put into office to stop.  We desperately need to overhaul how we approach financial regulation.  The President is taking action to protect American taxpayers and get people back to work. Moving on, we announced earlier this week that we would be taking steps to address Iran’s recent actions.  Today, the U.S. sanctioned 25 individuals and entities that provide support to Iran’s ballistic missile program and the Islamic Revolutionary Quds Force.  These designations are in response to Iran’s ongoing ballistic missile program, including its ballistic missile test on January 29, 2017, as well as Iran’s continued support for terrorism.  We’ve taken these actions today, after careful consideration, and will continue to respond with appropriate action. These designations mark yet another stop in our continued effort to aggressively target Iran’s ballistic missile program and terrorism-related activities.  Over at the Department of Defense, Secretary Mattis is on the final day of a two-day trip through Asia.  He visited Korea yesterday and Japan today, returning to Washington tomorrow.  Secretary Mattis’s visit emphasizes the priority President Trump places on the Asia-Pacific, and on strengthening the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance in the face of a growing North Korea nuclear and ballistic missile threat. Over in the Senate, the President now has 11 Cabinet nominees awaiting a full Senate vote on their confirmations.  We look forward to welcoming these individuals into the administration. Regarding the weekend’s plans, the President will debut his second weekly Facebook Live event this evening at 5 o’clock.  You can expect him to recap another week of action on behalf of the American people.  He’ll also comment on his selection of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  And while recognizing Black History Month, he will discuss his vision to deliver more opportunity and safety for the African-American community. One more note of this week’s address:  the lead-in to the President’s remark on Facebook Live will feature some of the incredible artwork throughout the White House that was created by African American artists, so you definitely don’t want to miss this. As I mentioned previously, this weekend the President will be shifting the operation of the White House down to the “Winter White House” at Mar-a-Lago.  While in Florida, he’ll hold meetings and calls with advisors and staff to plan for another big week of action on behalf of the American people.  We’ll provide readouts of these as they occur.  By our count, as of this morning the administration has already racked up more than 60 significant actions:  21 executive actions, 16 meetings with foreign leaders, and 10 stakeholder meetings, to name a few.   We’re looking forward to another productive week next week. On Monday, the President will visit Central Command and Special Operations Command Headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base. While at MacDill, the President will receive command briefings from both CENTCOM and SOCOM, have lunch with the enlisted troops, and have an all-hands address to personnel.  General Dunford and General Flynn will also be present for the meetings, and the President will return to Washington that evening. With that, I’m going to go my first Skype question seat.   Jackie Nespral from NBC 6 in South Florida.  Jackie. Q    Good afternoon.  On behalf of the viewers of South Florida, thanks so much for this opportunity.  You know, a lot of focus on foreign affairs this week, a new sanctions announced today against Iran, and of course Miami, as you know, is home to the largest Cuban-American community in the country.  And during the campaign, President Trump talked about his discontent with the warming of U.S.-Cuba relations implemented by President Obama.  And in the last days of his administration, he ended the ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy, leaving thousands of Cubans in limbo. So my question is twofold.  A, has there been any contact between your administration and the Cuban government?  And B, are there any plans to change the current policy right now? MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Jackie.  We are in the midst of a full review of all U.S. policies towards Cuba.  The President is committed to an agenda of ensuring human rights for all citizens throughout the world.  And as we review those policies in Cuba, that will be forefront in their policy discussions, but there is nothing that we have on that front at this point. Francesca Chambers. Q    Thank you, Sean.  Today, the United States put new sanctions on Iran.  Previously, this morning, the President had said that they were playing with fire.  You said that appropriate actions would continue to be taken.  Is this the full extent of the punishing actions that we’re seeing right now?  And are military options still on the table in response to the administration saying that all options are on the table? MR. SPICER:  Thanks for the question.  I think one of the things that the President has said throughout the campaign, during the transition, and since becoming President is that he doesn’t like to telegraph his options.  That’s how he believes that you can have a much greater successful option.   So I’m not going to go into the full extent, and I think today’s sanctions really represent a very, very strong stand against the actions that Iran has been taking and make it very clear that the deal that they struck previously was not in the best interest of this country, and that President Trump is going to do everything he can to make sure that Iran is stayed in check. Q    So it is possible that there are more actions coming, though? MR. SPICER:  I just -- I would never rule anything off the table.  I think the President has made it clear throughout his time that that’s what going to happen. Jeff. Q    Thanks a lot, Sean.  I wanted to ask about one of the members that has been announced as being part of President Trump’s team -- it's Gina Haspel.  Senator Ron Wyden has written to the President saying that her background makes her unsuitable to be the CIA Deputy Director.  And what he was specifically referencing was her role in the enhanced interrogation program that the CIA had during the course of the Bush administration.  Do you believe that this background is a disqualifier for that position? MR. SPICER:  I think she has had an unbelievably distinguished career as a covert operative.  She basically gave up that to come out and serve in this role at the request of Director Pompeo, and I think she has been a very, very distinguished servant to the American people and is highly qualified for that position. Next, I'm going to go to Josh McElveen over at -- from WMUR in New Hampshire. Q    Hey, Sean, thanks for taking the question.  I know you're looking forward to the Patriots coming down in a couple of months -- a lot of people up here are hoping that happens as well.  Getting to business, though, for more than two years, the number-one public health and safety threat facing this state is the heroin and opioid crisis.  During the campaign, the President promised to be swift and aggressive when it came to this problem -- stopping the flow of drugs coming across the border.  Increasingly, though, the problem lies in synthetic fentanyl being cooked up in labs in the northeast.  What is the administration doing on that front as well as the treatment aspect of addiction?   And secondly, if I may, with the understanding it is a state issue, New Hampshire is poised to become a ""right to work"" state, but the vote is expected to be close.  Given the administration's favorable view of ""right to work,"" is it actively engaged in that effort?  And if not, what is the general message from the White House? MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Josh.  First, on the opioid crisis, that is a major problem for not just New Hampshire but for so many states across the country.  I think one of the things beyond the health issue is to make sure that we're looking at borders use.  And the flow of heroin through our southern border is something that the President obviously takes -- that's part of his whole strong immigration stance, strong border security, having that wall built, having additional assets on the southern border will go a long way to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the country from our southern border up through the states. It was obviously, as you mentioned, a big issue that he made in New Hampshire throughout the primary and continued so on the campaign.  And that's something that as soon as Tom Price and others are confirmed throughout the department, this has got a health component to it, it's got a border issue to it.  So there is a multi-government approach that needs to be taken to the opioid crisis.   With respect to right to work, I think you accurately portrayed it.  The President believes in right to work.  He wants to give workers and companies the flexibility to do what's in the best interest for job creators.  Obviously, the Vice President has been a champion of this as well.  It's something that is a big deal in Indiana and something that he has championed as well. Blake. Q    Sean, I want to ask you about Dodd-Frank.  Beyond the executive order that's going to be signed here momentarily, is the administration planning on or working with Congress to overturn certain portions of the law itself that can be done with an executive order?  If so, what might that be?  What might that timeline be?  And can you say if a full repeal of Dodd-Frank is actively being considered or not? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think there's two aspects of this.  There's the administrative piece, which he's starting to address through executive action, and then there's a legislative piece that I think we're going to work with Congress on.  But I mean, I think I'd go back to what I said earlier -- that Dodd-Frank has been both a disaster in terms of the impact that it's had, but also it hasn't achieved the goal.  And I think that there's no question that the President talked about this extensively, the impact that it's had.  And it's not an either-or.  It's, frankly, just not doing what it set out to do.  And so I think we're going to continue not just to act through administrative action, but through working with Congress and figuring out a legislative fix. Major Garrett. Q    Sean, meeting with the Australian ambassador here yesterday with Chief of Staff Priebus and Steve Bannon -- can you describe what that meeting was about?  And did the administration make a commitment -- which we heard from the State Department yesterday -- that, in fact, all of those subject to the Obama administration agreement are still possible refugee re-settlers just with extreme vetting or some sort of process?  What was communicated?   And on the Iran sanctions, Adam Szubin is the Acting Treasury Secretary.  He was, of course, in charge of sanctions at the Treasury Department before.  Oftentimes these are a long time in development.  Were these sanctions something that were kind of on his desk or have been identified, and that's what made them so, if not easy, available to enact so rapidly? MR. SPICER:  Yeah, I think those are -- I think you correctly pointed out -- I mean, he served in the last administration.  These kind of sanctions don't happen quickly, but I think the timing of them was clearly in reaction to what we've seen over the last couple days.  We knew we had these options available to us because they had been worked through the process, but we acted swiftly and decisively today because the timing was right.  So they were in the pipeline, they had been staffed and approved, and the President made the decision that now was the time to do it based on recent action. Chief of Staff Priebus and Chief Strategist Bannon did meet with the Prime Minister yesterday.  I think they had a very productive --  Q    The ambassador. MR. SPICER:  The ambassador.  Thank you.  Appreciate the correction.  They did have a very productive and candid conversation.  We have a tremendous amount of respect for the people of Australia, for Prime Minister Turnbull, and it was a follow-up on the call.  But we're going to continue to work through this.  We're going to honor the commitments that we've made in some way, meaning that we are going to vet these people in accordance with the agreement that happened.  And we'll continue to have further updates as we do. John Roberts. Q    Sean, your statement last night on settlements in Israel -- has there been a shift in U.S. policy?  While you said that you didn't think that they were helpful to achieving peace, you also didn't think that they were an impediment to peace, which would represent a departure from both Obama and Bush.  And there was no reaffirmation of a two-state solution in that statement.  So where are you on that? MR. SPICER:  The President is committed to peace.  That's his goal.  And I think when the President and Prime Minister Netanyahu meet here on the 15th, that will obviously be the topic on that.  At the end of the day, the goal is peace.  And I think that's what you have to keep in mind.  I think that is going to be a subject that they discuss when they meet on the 15th, and that's as far as I want to go on that. Q    Sean, back to the settlement thing.  What is your position on settlements in terms of whether or not they -- I mean, you said that they were not an impediment to peace, but you also don't want them building new ones.   MR. SPICER:  Right. Q    So where are you --  MR. SPICER:  I mean, I think the statement is very clear about that.  We don't believe that the existence of current settlements is an impediment to peace, but I think the construction or expansion of existing settlements beyond the current borders is not going to be helpful moving forward. Trey.  Q    Two for you.  Seventeen members of Congress requested that President Trump not interfere with the current way unemployment is calculated by the Department of Labor.  Does the President intend to comply with their request?  And a related question -- how many of the 227,000 jobs added to the U.S. in January does the President attribute to his administration versus the Obama administration? MR. SPICER:  I think, look, when you look at the confidence indexes, I'm not going to get into -- unfortunately, we don't have that kind of a breakdown.  I think that you've seen the actions that he's taken, whether it's Carrier or some of the other companies -- Sprint, SoftBank.  Clearly there is a desire for companies to want to come be part of this Trump agenda and build and manufacture, create jobs, bring jobs back.  But I'm not at liberty to start parsing the BLS and other reports as far as where that comes down.   But look, his team, led by Gary Cohn, was really pleased with the numbers this morning.  Obviously, we're pleased that we're -- 227,000 jobs is a great kickoff.  We hope they get better.  We know that there's a lot more work to do, and that's why the President continues to meet with business leaders, union leaders to help figure out how we can grow the economy. Ashley. Q    The government revealed in an Alexandria court case today that over 100,000 visas have now been revoked as part of the President's travel ban.  Does that include visa holders who are already in the United States?  And will the government begin finding them and trying to deport them? MR. SPICER:  I'll have to get back to you on that.  I don't have all the details on that right now. Q    Six hours ago, the President tweeted that professional anarchists, thugs and paid protestors are proving the point of millions of people who voted to make America great again.  Does the administration have any intention of investigating the groups who have been rioting at conservative or pro-Trump events? MR. SPICER:  I think we know who they are.  I don't know that we need to do an investigation. Q    Has the President seen the letter sent from Senator McCain yesterday?  And if so, is he looking into arming the Ukrainians? MR. SPICER:  I don't know.  I'll have to get back to you on that. Charlie. Q    Ambassador Nikki Haley came out with a strong statement on Russia yesterday.  Does the administration have plans to keep the sanctions against Russia in place, or do they have any intention of adding more sanctions? MR. SPICER:  So there's two things.  One, I think I commented the other day on the sanctions that Treasury put out.  Those are, in fact, routine -- or the clarification -- they are a routine clarification that occurs.  With respect to the sanctions, I think Ambassador Haley made it very clear of our concern with Russia's occupation of Crimea.  We are not -- and so I think she spoke very forcefully and clearly on that.  If I can, I'd like to go to the third Skype question.  Christopher Sign from ABC15 in Arizona. Q    Sean, thank you for doing this.  Hello from a sunny and beautiful Phoenix.  With the likely confirmation on the horizon with a new Veteran Affairs Secretary, there has been discussion regarding privatizing the VA.  There's also still concerns regarding wait times, even overall care and some reports regarding a suicide rate.  What is the reform that the administration is seeking here?  Also, will the administration protect whistleblowers?   Second part of the question -- we've seen protests here in Phoenix, as in the nationwide as well.  When you talk about unity, what is the administration doing to bring more unity to the nation, and even more transparency?  As here in Phoenix, we saw that secret meeting on the tarmac.  How is the administration repairing all of this? MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Chris.  First, I mean, I think the President, mostly through deed, continues to show that he wants to bring people together in this country, figure out how to move the country forward, both economically, job-wise.  I think that is something that he continues to show a desire for.  He talked about it in his inaugural address and the prayer breakfast.   So I think he's going to continue to show through both word and deed his desire to move the country forward.  I'm trying to think -- can you go back to the first part? Q    That's all right -- the confirmation -- the likely confirmation of the VA Secretary.    MR. SPICER:  Oh yeah, Dr. Shulkin.  Yeah, look, I think first and foremost on VA reform, the number one thing is to get Dr. Shulkin confirmed.  And so many of these, as I brought up in the past couple days, it's hard to talk about how we're going to enact an agenda of reform when Senate Democrats continue to slow-walk some of these folks.  And I think that's a big problem.  Dr. Shulkin is the right individual to reform the VA -- to understand whether it's lending or medical care, the problems and the challenges that we face at the VA.  These are people who have served our nation and deserve the best care they can get, whether that's the mortgage lending, health care, or the variety of other stuff that the VA serves or provides to our veterans.  And I think that what the President has done is talk to people like Dr. Toby Cusgrove at Cleveland Clinic and other business leaders about providing a better approach to serving the needs of our veterans.   Right now, you're right, there are still wait times that are unacceptable.  There's care that's unacceptable.  We've got to address that, and he's going to continue to do it. David Jackson. Q    Sean, during the campaign, candidate Trump repeatedly said he was going to void the Iranian nuclear deal.  Bottom line -- is he going to do that, or is he going to let it stay? MR. SPICER:  I think today's action speaks for itself in terms of the sanctions.  He's made it very, very clear, David, that the deal that was struck was a bad deal, that we gave Iran too much and we got too little for it.  And I think that he is going to continue to be tough on Iran in a way that wasn’t done in the last eight years.  I think today's actions and the way that we expedited those sanctions are another example of how he's going to stay tough on them. Let me go to the fourth Skype seat.  Dale Jackson from WVNN Talk Radio in Huntsville, Alabama. Q    Sean, thank you very much for taking questions from outside the elite media bubble there in D.C.  My question is about immigration.  Donald Trump made this the forefront of his campaign, the foundation of it, yet the DACA and DAPA programs still exist.  And I learned from a member of Congress yesterday that the Trump administration is still issuing the work permits that (inaudible) individuals.   Question one is, when are these programs going to be ended?   And question two, when will they stop issuing work permits to these individuals? MR. SPICER:  Thanks, Dale.  I think as you know, Secretary Kelly just assumed office.  We are reviewing these programs.  We've made it very clear that we'll have further updates on immigration referring to DACA and DAPA.  The President has made significant progress on addressing the pledge that he made to the American people regarding immigration problems that we face, and I think we're going to see more action on that in the next few weeks.   Yes, sir. Q    Sean, yesterday the President described NAFTA as a catastrophe.  We've heard about his concerns with Mexico, but I'm wondering if you can outline some of the irritants that he finds along the Canadian border, and if there's any talk of a meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau. MR. SPICER:  I think he has spoken to Prime Minister Trudeau.  I know that they're looking at setting up a time to come down.  We've been in constant contact with Canadian officials, and I think that will be a meeting that is set up very shortly. Sarah. Q    Thanks, Sean.  Russia's foreign minister has pressed the administration for further details on the President's plans to establish safe zones in Syria.  The President has said to have discussed this yesterday with King Abdullah.  When can we expect further details on that plan? MR. SPICER:  That's a good question.  I think that we are -- as you noted in the readouts from last weekend, that has been a subject that has come up with all of the Middle East leaders that he's talked about.  It's an area that he feels strongly about.  And I think as he continues to have follow-up conversations, we can expect further details.  It's something that -- Secretary Tillerson obviously just got sworn into office, -- that there will be further follow-up on that. Yeah. Q    The President will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Abe next Friday. MR. SPICER:  Yes. Q    So what's the main topic for the meeting?  Will the President tell Japanese Prime Minister Abe that Japan should pay more and pick up all the expense (inaudible) in Japan? MR. SPICER:  I think there's going to be a lot of both trade and national security.  I think as we get closer to that meeting, I'll have further information on it.  But right now, as you can imagine, there's an economic aspect to this, and then there's a national security aspect to this.   Glenn. Q    Sean, you have referenced polls a couple of times from the podium, but a poll came out today.  CBS says the President has a 40 percent approval rating.  We've seen the approval rating drop during the transition period.  He talked about polls a great deal during the campaign.  A, what do you think that says about the way the American people are looking at these actions that he's taking?  And, B, what do you think it says about his pledge to unite the country on the eve of his election? MR. SPICER:  I think there's also a Rasmussen poll that showed he had a 51 percent approval rating.  You had an Ipsos/Reuters poll that other day that showed -- and again, I don’t have it handy, but a majority of people approved -- Q    (Inaudible) those.   MR. SPICER:  I understand that.  And I think that as the President's policies continue to get enacted, for all the hysteria regarding his efforts to protect the country, on those seven countries where we didn’t have the proper vetting in place to ensure that the American people were safe, what we did have was a very high response from the American people in support of that.  His policies continue to do it.  The President understands this is a marathon, and not a sprint.  And as he continues to get people back to work, protect this country, I think the poll numbers will act in accord. Q    Sean, you mentioned the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Does the administration intend to keep Richard Cordray as the head of that agency? MR. SPICER:  I don’t have a staff announcement on the CFPB right now, but we'll see where we go. Q    You criticize the bureau broadly, but do you want to see it stay in place? MR. SPICER:  I think we'll have further updates on that.  That's an area that we need to work with Congress on. April. Q    Okay, Sean, two things.  One, you said something about President Trump talking on the Facebook Live that he was going to talk about Black History Month and issues pertaining to the African American community.  When you first came, a couple days into the administration, I asked you about the agenda, the black agenda that he had possibly formulated or he was formulating as he came out maybe the day before with the issue of Chicago, or the day after -- something around that time -- Chicago and sending the Feds in if it doesn’t change.  Has he now formulated a plan to deal with the black community, not just with issues of law and order?  What is that -- MR. SPICER:  I mean, he had a meeting with African American leaders the other day in the Roosevelt Room.  I think part of this is, to your point, it isn’t just law and order -- it's jobs, it's education, it's health care, small business lending.  There's a lot that goes along with that agenda.  And I think part of these business meetings they have are about hiring and small business and job creation.  All of those issues, I think, are at the forefront of small business -- or that community.  So it's not just a single thing.  I think that there's a lot, whether it's crime and law and order, or education, health care, small business, job creation.  That impacts that entire segment of the population, whether they're living in a rural part of the country or an inner city.  And I think that's what he's really focused on right now.   Q    Sean -- Q    Wait, I'm not finished.  So he's now formulating the agenda? MR. SPICER:  Absolutely.  Q    Okay.  So the second question -- CVE.  What's on the table for that?   MR. SPICER:  We're not getting -- I have nothing to announce on that right now. Q    You have nothing to announce, but people are concerned -- MR. SPICER:  I understand people.  I understand we've heard a lot of rumors about what may or may not.  When we have something to announce on that, we will do it.  But I don’t think it should be any surprise that the President, when it comes to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism, which is what that initially was supposed to be focused on, he is going to make sure that that is a major focus of his -- keeping this country safe.  And so I don’t have anything further for you on that.  I'm just -- Q    What about excluding people -- there are reports about excluding white supremacists from -- MR. SPICER:  There are a reports.  I don’t have anything for you.  I just said I don’t have anything for you, but I will be very clear that this President's commitment to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism is something that is at the forefront of his agenda.  And I know that there's been a lot of reports about where that program or that effort is going to lie.  Q    Is there going to be any kind of target on the issues of white supremacy? MR. SPICER:  I have nothing else.  Thank you, April. Cecilia. Q    Sean, thank you.  The President has been using some tough talk, tough language on Iran -- ""playing with fire.""  Should Americans be ready for the possibility of military action with Iran?  Is that on the table? MR. SPICER:  Look, I've said this before, the President has been very clear:  He doesn’t take options off the table but he understands the impact of something like that.  The sanctions today I think are going to be very, very strong and impactful.  And I hope that Iran realizes that after the provocative measures that they've taken, that they understand that this President and this administration is not going to sit back and take it lightly.   John Gizzi. Q    Thank you, Sean.  On Monday, several published reports saying that it will be a tie in the Senate on the confirmation of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education, and Mike Pence will have to cast a historic tie-breaking vote as Vice President.  Should we be watching for any surprises?  Has the Congressional Affairs Office perhaps gotten one more vote from the ""no"" camp into the ""yes""?  Or do you expect the Vice President to be on hand to confirm her? MR. SPICER:  Look, I would say this:  Betsy DeVos, as I mentioned before, is an unbelievable champion of education -- for children, for teachers, for parents.  I hope that that vote gets 60, 70 votes.  She is an unbelievable, remarkable woman who has fought very hard to improve our nation's education system and to make sure that schools are serving children.  And I think that we are going to make sure we do everything we can, and we feel 100 percent confident that she will be confirmed Monday night and be the next Secretary of Education. Thank you, guys.  Have a great weekend.  The President is about to sign executive orders.  I hope you all have a great weekend.  To those of you who can't travel down to Florida, we'll be gaggling on the plane on Monday.  Thank you.  Have a great weekend.   END  1:07 P.M.

EST THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all for being here.  I had a lot of good discussions this morning.  I'm negotiating a lot of contracts that are saving billions and billions of dollars for the American people and for all of us, and I'm very proud of it. You know, the F-35 fighter jet, the Air Force One program, which was totally out of control and now it's back where it's supposed to go, and many other things.  In addition, I had a very good phone call this morning about a major plant that's moving back into the United States.  We'll be talking about it soon.   And what I do have is a little free time at about 12 o'clock.  So I don't think the press will want to show up, but I think I'll have a press conference probably at 12 o'clock in the East Room.  We had a little time in between things.  So if the press would like to show up -- will anybody show up to that press conference?  (Laughter.)  Historically, they didn't care about these things.  For me, they show up.  So I think 12 o'clock in the East Room of the White House we'll have a press conference. I just want to thank you folks for coming today.  This was good.  This was scheduled a long time ago -- some of my very, very early supporters.  And I've been your supporter also.  We're doing really well.  The fake-news media doesn't like talking about the economy; I never see anything about the stock market sets new records every day.  I never see it.  But I think the people understand it.   We're giving a speech in Melbourne, Florida on Saturday.  I think it's going to be around 4 o'clock.  and I hear the tickets, you can't get them, but that's okay.  It's better than you have too many, right?  So it's going to be great.  I look forward to that.  So that will be Melbourne at 4 o'clock.  I really appreciate you folks.  You folks have been so great.  And right from the beginning, and, Tom, right at the beginning.  Just about every one of you, right at the beginning.  Some of you were a little after the beginning.  (Laughter.)  But we forgive.  But we forgive.   Let's go around, just for the media, and you'll introduce yourselves and then we'll start talking, and I'll see the media back at 12 o'clock.  Chris? CONGRESSMAN COLLINS:  Well, Mr. President, we're all honored to be here.  This is really our Trump caucus reconvening for the first time in a little bit, but our first meeting was the first part of March.  Duncan Hunter and I both endorsed you on February 24th, a week from tomorrow.  So it’s the one-year anniversary.  But this is the Trump caucus, reconvening, and we’re just so honored you’re taking time out of your busy schedule to be with us. THE PRESIDENT:  These are real friends. CONGRESSMAN COLLINS:  Western New York. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That’s right.   CONGRESSMAN HUNTER:  Duncan Hunter, Mr. President, from San Diego, California.   CONGRESSMAN CRAMER:  Kevin Cramer from North Dakota. CONGRESSMAN SHUSTER:  Bill Shuster from Western Pennsylvania and chairman of the transportation committee.  THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  We’re going to give you some money for transportation.  That’s good.  Good territory. CONGRESSMAN REED:  Mr. President, Tom Reed.  It was a pleasure to travel with you to Florida. THE PRESIDENT:  That’s right. CONGRESSMAN REED:  Congratulations. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you. CONGRESSMAN MARINO:  Mr. President, Tom Marino from Williamsburg, Pennsylvania.  And please indulge me for 30 seconds.  I have something for you.   THE PRESIDENT:  Uh oh.  (Laughter.)   PARTICIPANT:  Something for you to sign, I think he means.  (Laughter.)   THE PRESIDENT:  I think this is great.   CONGRESSMAN MARINO:  This is a portrait by an engineer -- a gentleman, Joe Padmerino(ph), who -- 60-some years old.  Never voted.  Never registered.  He registered for you and voted for you, and he asked me to give this to you.  There’s a nice letter there.  I’m sorry, Mr. Vice President -- but that’s that.  I’ll set this over here. THE PRESIDENT:  That’s beautiful.  Thank you. CONGRESSMAN MARINO:  (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:  He’s a talented guy, I can see that. CONGRESSMAN MARINO:  And the other thing here is -- THE PRESIDENT:  It's nice. CONGRESSMAN MARINO:  -- the chairman and CEO of Little League World Series baseball here. THE PRESIDENT:  Right. CONGRESSMAN MARINO:  And, Mr. Vice President, I kind of figured that you would be here as well, so this is from the New York team last year that was in the World Series.  That’s for you.  And this is a jersey that -- an original jersey of the New York team in the World Series last year.  And this is for you as well.   THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  (Laughter and applause.)  Okay.  All right.  Thank them for me.   CONGRESSMAN MARINO:  I will do that.   THE PRESIDENT:  Thank them for me.  Rick, we know who you are. CONGRESSMAN DESJARLAIS:  Scott DesJarlais from Tennessee.  And I just want you to know that Tennessee was falling behind in March -- and we're excited about the work you’re doing.  We know that health care and tax reform has to be done this year, and we like the work you’re doing, and we need you to help us.   THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to get it done.  And the health care is going really well.  And now that we finally have Tom, Tom Price -- so that’s a big thing.  I mean, we couldn’t get him.  We are going to be announcing -- I guess I’ll do it at 12 o'clock -- a new Secretary of Labor, who is really phenomenal.  So that will be at 12 o'clock.  And we’re getting -- I mean, this is the slowest in history, the approval of a Cabinet.  And these people are outstanding people.  The man I’ll be announcing for Labor is a star, great person.  A great person. And so I look forward to that.  But I appreciate everything you've done.  You've been fantastic, and I appreciate that.  Thank you.   CONGRESSMAN KELLY:  Mr. President, good to see you.  Mike Kelly. THE PRESIDENT:  I know, Mike. CONGRESSMAN KELLY:  From right above Pittsburgh, up near Erie.  Thanks so much.  What an exciting summer we had together. THE PRESIDENT:  We did okay.   CONGRESSMAN KELLY:  We did better than okay. THE PRESIDENT:  We took an area that wasn’t a big Republican area, and we swamped them, right?  (Laughter.)  CONGRESSMAN KELLY:  We did.  We did.  Thirty-four years since Erie actually voted for a Republican. THE PRESIDENT:  Wow. CONGRESSMAN KELLY:  Thanks to you. THE PRESIDENT:  Well, thank you very much.  CONGRESSMAN KELLY:  Yes, sir. CONGRESSMAN LONG:  Billy Long, Missouri 7th.  And I’m co-chair of the Congressional Study Group on Japan.  I’m going to be leading the delegation to Japan Saturday, meeting with Prime Minister Abe on Monday.   THE PRESIDENT:  He’s a great guy. CONGRESSMAN LONG:  So if you will tell me how many golf balls he lost in Florida.  I don't know how many House of Representative golf balls to take.  (Laughter.)   THE PRESIDENT:  He played well, I'll tell you.  And you know, we played with Ernie Els.  I called up Billy -- I said, see if you can get me somebody good to play with; I have the Prime Minister of Japan who wants to play golf.  So we get to the front of the club, and Ernie Els is waiting for us.  He said, when you're ready.  So we had a good time. No, he played very nicely, and he’s a great guy.  You're going to like him.  I like him. CONGRESSMAN LONG:  Oh, yeah, I’ve met him the last three or four years -- met with him there.  He’s a great guy.  And I knew you all would hit it off because you're both people persons and a great personalities. THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we had a good feeling. CONGRESSMAN LONG:  So I knew you guys would get along good. THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I always said about President Obama, it’s great to play golf, but play golf with heads of countries.  And, by the way, people like yourself, when you're looking for votes, don't play with your friends who you play with every week.  (Laughter.)  Does that make sense? CONGRESSMAN LONG:  Yeah, it does. THE PRESIDENT:  I hit it off with the Prime Minister.  He is a fabulous guy.  He’s -- loves his country.  And we spoke all day long and well into the night.  As you know, they launched a missile in North Korea, and we were discussing that.  So it was really something.   But have a good time over there.  CONGRESSMAN LONG:  I will. THE PRESIDENT:  And give him my regards. CONGRESSMAN LONG:  Ambassador Sasae was in my district for two full days, and he mentioned he was with you down there to play golf. THE PRESIDENT:  He was. CONGRESSMAN LONG:  He’s another great guy -- he and his wife both. THE PRESIDENT:  They're all good. CONGRESSMAN LONG:  One last quick thing.  Fran Drescher, from “The Nanny” --  THE PRESIDENT:  Right.  CONGRESSMAN LONG:  -- said you were on “The Nanny” one time.  She has a request with her battle for cancer that you have a cancer board that has one non-medical person.  So she wanted me to put her name in the hat for that.  My daughter came through a successful cancer battle. THE PRESIDENT:  She’s fought hard.  She’s fought hard.  Yes.  You know what, if you would, Billy, why don't you give me that request?  And we’ll see if we can do that. CONGRESSMAN LONG:  We will.  I’ll give it to your people.  Thank you.  THE PRESIDENT:  Marsha. CONGRESSWOMAN BLACKBURN:  Yes, I’m Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee.  I chair the Telecommunications and Technology Subcommittee of Energy and Commerce.  And we are looking forward to broadband expansion.  Go broadband! THE PRESIDENT:  We're going to get it. CONGRESSWOMAN BLACKBURN:  Yes.  All right. THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody.  I’ll see you at 12 o’clock if you want.  If you don't want, don't be there.  (Laughter.)  If you don't show up, I won’t be offended.  (Laughter.)   Q    Are you going to find some of those leakers, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT:  We're going to find the leakers.  We're going to find the leakers.  They're going to pay a big price for leaking.  It’s all about the leakers.  You know the Russians are just a muse -- it’s all about the leakers.

Arthur The son of a Baptist preacher who had emigrated from northern Ireland, Chester A. Arthur was America's 21st President (1881-85), succeeding President James Garfield upon his assassination.  Dignified, tall, and handsome, with clean-shaven chin and side-whiskers, Chester A. Arthur ""looked like a President."" The son of a Baptist preacher who had emigrated from northern Ireland, Arthur was born in Fairfield, Vermont, in 1829. He was graduated from Union College in 1848, taught school, was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in New York City. Early in the Civil War he served as Quartermaster General of the State of New York. President Grant in 1871 appointed him Collector of the Port of New York. Arthur effectively marshalled the thousand Customs House employees under his supervision on behalf of Roscoe Conkling's Stalwart Republican machine. Honorable in his personal life and his public career, Arthur nevertheless was a firm believer in the spoils system when it was coming under vehement attack from reformers. He insisted upon honest administration of the Customs House, but staffed it with more employees than it needed, retaining them for their merit as party workers rather than as Government officials. In 1878 President Hayes, attempting to reform the Customs House, ousted Arthur. Conkling and his followers tried to win redress by fighting for the renomination of Grant at the 1880 Republican Convention. Failing, they reluctantly accepted the nomination of Arthur for the Vice Presidency. During his brief tenure as Vice President, Arthur stood firmly beside Conkling in his patronage struggle against President Garfield. But when Arthur succeeded to the Presidency, he was eager to prove himself above machine politics. Avoiding old political friends, he became a man of fashion in his garb and associates, and often was seen with the elite of Washington, New York, and Newport. To the indignation of the Stalwart Republicans, the onetime Collector of the Port of New York became, as President, a champion of civil service reform. Public pressure, heightened by the assassination of Garfield, forced an unwieldy Congress to heed the President. In 1883 Congress passed the Pendleton Act, which established a bipartisan Civil Service Commission, forbade levying political assessments against officeholders, and provided for a ""classified system"" that made certain Government positions obtainable only through competitive written examinations. The system protected employees against removal for political reasons. Acting independently of party dogma, Arthur also tried to lower tariff rates so the Government would not be embarrassed by annual surpluses of revenue. Congress raised about as many rates as it trimmed, but Arthur signed the Tariff Act of 1883. Aggrieved Westerners and Southerners looked to the Democratic Party for redress, and the tariff began to emerge as a major political issue between the two parties. The Arthur Administration enacted the first general Federal immigration law. Arthur approved a measure in 1882 excluding paupers, criminals, and lunatics. Congress suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, later making the restriction permanent. Arthur demonstrated as President that he was above factions within the Republican Party, if indeed not above the party itself. Perhaps in part his reason was the well-kept secret he had known since a year after he succeeded to the Presidency, that he was suffering from a fatal kidney disease. He kept himself in the running for the Presidential nomination in 1884 in order not to appear that he feared defeat, but was not renominated, and died in 1886. Publisher Alexander K. McClure recalled, ""No man ever entered the Presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted, and no one ever retired ... more generally respected.""

Hayes (1877-1881). Nicknamed affectionately both ""Mother Lucy"" and ""Lemonade Lucy"", she was well known for caring for wounded infantrymen in her husband's command during the Civil War and for her staunch support of the temperance movement, respectively. There was no inaugural ball in 1877--when Rutherford B. Hayes and his wife, Lucy, left Ohio for Washington, the outcome of the election was still in doubt. Public fears had not subsided when it was settled in Hayes' favor; and when Lucy watched her husband take his oath of office at the Capitol, her serene and beautiful face impressed even cynical journalists. She came to the White House well loved by many. Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, daughter of Maria Cook and Dr. James Webb, she lost her father at age two. She was just entering her teens when Mrs. Webb took her sons to the town of Delaware to enroll in the new Ohio Wesleyan University, but she began studying with its excellent instructors. She graduated from the Wesleyan Female College in Cincinnati at 18, unusually well educated for a young lady of her day. ""Rud"" Hayes at 27 had set up a law practice in Cincinnati, and he began paying calls at the Webb home. References to Lucy appeared in his diary: ""Her low sweet voice is very winning ... a heart as true as steel.... Intellect she has too.... By George! I am in love with her!"" Married in 1852, they lived in Cincinnati until the Civil War, and he soon came to share her deeply religious opposition to slavery. Visits to relatives and vacation journeys broke the routine of a happy domestic life in a growing family. Over twenty years Lucy bore eight children, of whom five grew up. She won the affectionate name of ""Mother Lucy"" from men of the 23rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry who served under her husband's command in the war. They remembered her visits to camp--to minister to the wounded, cheer the homesick, and comfort the dying. Hayes' distinguished combat record earned him election to Congress, and three postwar terms as governor of Ohio. She not only joined him in Washington for its winter social season, she also accompanied him on visits to state reform schools, prisons, and asylums. As the popular first lady of her state, she gained experience in what a woman of her time aptly called ""semi-public life."" Thus she entered the White House with confidence gained from her long and happy married life, her knowledge of political circles, her intelligence and culture, and her cheerful spirit. She enjoyed informal parties, and spared no effort to make official entertaining attractive. Though she was a temperance advocate and liquor was banned at the mansion during this administration, she was a very popular hostess. She took criticism of her views in good humor (the famous nickname ""Lemonade Lucy"" apparently came into use only after she had left the mansion). She became one of the best-loved women to preside over the White House, where the Hayeses celebrated their silver wedding anniversary in 1877, and an admirer hailed her as representing ""the new woman era."" The Hayes term ended in 1881, and the family home was now ""Spiegel Grove,"" an estate at Fremont, Ohio. There husband and wife spent eight active, contented years together until her death in 1889. She was buried in Fremont, mourned by her family and hosts of friends.

Glin Twitter Facebook Email  Summary: C.D. Glin, a former Peace Corps Volunteer and Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Partnerships with Peace Corps, explains his experience as one of the first Peace Corps Volunteers in South Africa. Peace Corps Volunteer C.D. Glin with children in his South African community, 1997 March 29, 2011. (by Peace Corps) Ed. Note: In October 1994, Presidents Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela met to seal a bond of friendship and a promise to work together to transform South Africa from a divided nation to one united by its commitment to build a democratic, nonracially based society.  The Peace Corps was a small but important part of that agreement.  Today there are 152 Peace Corps Volunteers in South Africa working in the fields of education and NGO development. As long as I can remember, I have aspired to live and work in Africa.  As a young African American growing up, I wrote anti-apartheid rap songs in high school, interned with an Africa advocacy group, and even shook Nelson Mandela’s hand at a reception during my junior year of college at Howard University.   While interning in Accra in 1994, I had the opportunity to meet Peace Corps Volunteers serving in Ghana.  They were community leaders welcomed by Ghanian communities, communicating in local languages and sharing new ideas. Once learning about Peace Corps service, I only had two thoughts: Why hadn’t I heard about this sooner? And: Where could I sign up?  That year, President Mandela invited the Peace Corps to South Africa and asked for a Volunteer group that truly reflected the diversity of America. In January 1997, the Peace Corps swore-in the first group of 35 Volunteers going to South Africa, and I was among them.  The assignment for our group was in elementary school education, serving in South Africa’s Northern Province (now renamed Limpopo Province) as liaisons, advisors and trainers for local teachers.  The goal was to help implement a new national education curriculum that offered parity among people and replaced the current curriculum, which was based on ethnicity, race, and color. To better communicate with my community, I learned an African language, Northern Sotho.  I took pride in learning a new language and culture, though it came with some frustration; I would inevitably be drawn into the same questions. “Where are you from?” “I’m from the States,” I’d reply. “No, I mean where are you really from?” “From the States,” I’d say again, this time more emphatically. Then came looks of confusion and annoyance. Why, they wondered, would I deny my heritage and language? Surely I was African. They would try a new tack. “Well, where are your parents from?” And on and on it went. These conversations of heritage and where I came from often led to discussions about slavery and the number of people of African descent in the United States.  As I gave impromptu history lessons, I always mentioned the similarities I saw between South Africa and the United States and the struggle for racial equality.  Exactly 40 years after Brown vs. Board of Education struck down “separate but equal” in the United States, apartheid was struck down with the first national multi-ethnic democratic election in South Africa’s history.  In response to frustrations expressed that their personal circumstances hadn’t immediately changed, even though the government had, I would explain that slavery in America was followed by a reconstruction period and the civil rights movement. I feel privileged to have played a small part in South Africa’s civil rights movement as it transitioned into a democracy, and I am grateful that the Peace Corps gave me this opportunity.  As the Director of Intergovernmental Affairs and Partnerships at the Peace Corps, and a former staff member of the Office of Minority Recruitment at the Peace Corps, I continue to support Peace Corps’ efforts to ensure that Volunteers reflect the face of America and that everyone is provided with opportunity to serve. C.D. Glin served in South Africa from 1997-1999 and currently, is the Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Partnerships with the Peace Corps.

Serving as the First Lady from 1977 to 1981, she was an envoy abroad and a leading advocate for numerous causes, including mental health research. ""She's the girl I want to marry,"" Jimmy Carter told his mother after his first date with 17-year-old Rosalynn Smith, who had grown up as a friend and neighbor of the Carter family in Plains, Georgia. Born in Plains on August 18, 1927, Rosalynn was the first of four children in the family of Allethea Murray Smith and Wilburn Edgar Smith. She grew up in a small-town atmosphere that nurtured strong ties to family and dedication to church and community. When she was 13, her father died and her mother became a dressmaker to help support the family. As the oldest child, Rosalynn worked beside her mother, helping with the sewing, the housekeeping, and the other children. Times were difficult, but Rosalynn completed high school and enrolled in Georgia Southwestern College at Americus. In 1945, after her freshman year, she first dated Jimmy Carter, who was home from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Their romance progressed, and in 1946 they were married. The young couple went to Norfolk, Virginia, Ensign Carter's first duty station after graduation. The Navy kept them on the move. Their sons were born in different places: John William in Virginia, James Earl III in Hawaii, and Donnel Jeffrey in Connecticut. The Carters' only daughter, Amy Lynn, was born in Georgia in 1967. When his father died in 1953, Jimmy left the service, and the Carters returned to Plains to run the family business. Managing the accounts of the peanut, fertilizer, and seed enterprise, Rosalynn soon found herself working full-time. Jimmy entered politics in 1962, winning a seat in the Georgia Senate. Rosalynn, an important member of his campaign team, helped develop support for her husband's successful bid for the governorship of Georgia in 1970. During his Presidential campaigns, Rosalynn traveled independently throughout the United States. Her belief in her husband's ability to lead the nation was communicated in a quiet, friendly manner that made her an effective campaigner. A skillful speaker and a hardworking First Lady, Mrs. Carter managed routine duties and special projects in her office in the East Wing. She attended Cabinet meetings and major briefings, frequently represented the Chief Executive at ceremonial occasions, and served as the President's personal emissary to Latin American countries. As First Lady, she focused national attention on the performing arts. She invited to the White House leading classical artists from around the world, as well as traditional American artists. She also took a strong interest in programs to aid mental health, the community, and the elderly. From 1977 to 1978, she served as the Honorary Chairperson of the President's Commission on Mental Health. After returning home, Mrs. Carter wrote her autobiography, First Lady From Plains, published in 1984. She is currently vice chair of The Carter Center in Atlanta, founded in 1982 to promote peace and human rights worldwide. At the Center, she leads a program to diminish stigma against mental illness and to promote greater access to mental health care. She also is a partner with the ex-president in projects to resolve conflict, promote human rights, improve global health, and build democracy in some 65 countries.

Trump Names Lt. General Joseph Keith Kellogg, Jr. as Acting National Security Advisor President Donald J. Trump has named Lt. General Joseph Keith Kellogg, Jr. (Ret) as Acting National Security Advisor following the resignation of Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret).  General Kellogg is a decorated veteran of the United States Army, having served from 1967 to 2003, including two tours during the Vietnam War, where he earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star with “V” device, and the Air Medal with “V” device.  He served as the Commander of the 82nd Airborne Division from 1997 to 1998.  Prior to his retirement, General Kellogg was Director of the Command, Control, Communications, and Computers Directorate under the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The full text of General Flynn’s resignation letter is below: February 13, 2017 In the course of my duties as the incoming National Security Advisor, I held numerous phone calls with foreign counterparts, ministers, and ambassadors. These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the President, his advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude. Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology. Throughout my over thirty three years of honorable military service, and my tenure as the National Security Advisor, I have always performed my duties with the utmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States. I am tendering my resignation, honored to have served our nation and the American people in such a distinguished way. I am also extremely honored to have served President Trump, who in just three weeks, has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America's leadership position in the world. As I step away once again from serving my nation in this current capacity, I wish to thank President Trump for his personal loyalty, the friendship of those who I worked with throughout the hard fought campaign, the challenging period of transition, and during the early days of his presidency. I know with the strong leadership of President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and the superb team they are assembling, this team will go down in history as one of the greatest presidencies in U.S. history, and I firmly believe the American people will be well served as they all work together to help Make America Great Again.

Since then, the program’s protections have grown to cover other life events, like disability, the loss of a loved one, or severe financial hardship. More than seventy-five years ago, Social Security began with a promise to protect all Americans from a life of poverty in old age.  Since then, the program’s protections have grown to cover other life events, like disability, the loss of a loved one, or severe financial hardship.  Many Americans may think Social Security is only about retirement, but it actually can benefit people well before they retire.  Now the Social Security Administration is teaming up with President Obama’s Open Government initiative to help educate Americans about these important benefits. Open Government—built on the principles of transparency and public participation—has been a hallmark of this Administration and continues to engage Americans in a dialogue about their government and what it does on their behalf.  To this end, the Social Security Administration will host a webinar, Social Security 101: What’s In It For Me?  on March 10th at 3pm EST/Noon PST.  Viewers will gain a better understanding of how Social Security provides support through both unexpected and predictable life events. Participants will connect through an interactive, online medium and get answers to questions like, “What’s that FICA tax that comes out of my paycheck?” and “Why do I need to start planningnow for my financial future?” The webinar will be geared especially towards college students and young workers—many of whom may not realize what Social Security has to offer—but it will also be an opportunity for people of all ages to learn more about one of this country’s most important programs. Watch, learn something new, and join the conversation.  RSVP and view the webinar here.

Bush George W. Bush, America's 43rd President (2001-2009), was transformed into a wartime President in the aftermath of the airborne terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, facing the ""greatest challenge of any President since Abraham Lincoln.""  The airborne terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the thwarted flight against the White House or Capitol on September 11, 2001, in which nearly 3,000 Americans were killed, transformed George W. Bush into a wartime president. The attacks put on hold many of Bush’s hopes and plans, and Bush’s father, George Bush, the 41st president, declared that his son “faced the greatest challenge of any president since Abraham Lincoln.” In response, Bush formed a new cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security, sent American forces into Afghanistan to break up the Taliban, a movement under Osama bin Laden that trained financed and exported terrorist teams. The Taliban was successfully disrupted but Bin Laden was not captured and was still on the loose as Bush began his second term. Following the attacks, the president also recast the nation’s intelligence gathering and analysis services, and ordered reform of the military forces to meet the new enemy. At the same time he delivered major tax cuts which had been a campaign pledge. His most controversial act was the invasion of Iraq on the belief that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein posed a grave threat to the United States. Saddam was captured, but the disruption of Iraq and the killing of American servicemen and friendly Iraqis by insurgents became the challenge of Bush’s government as he began his second term. President Bush pledged during his 2005 State of the Union Address that the United States would help the Iraqi people establish a fully democratic government because the victory of freedom in Iraq would strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, bring hope to a troubled region, and lift a threat from the lives of future generations. Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut while his father was attending Yale University after service in World War II. The family moved to Midland, Texas, where the senior Bush entered the oil exploration business. The son spent formative years there, attended Midland public schools, and formed friendships that stayed with him into the White House. Bush graduated from Yale, received a business degree from Harvard, and then returned to Midland where he too got into the oil business. In Midland he met and married Laura Welch, a teacher and librarian. They had twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, now out of college and pursuing careers. When George W. Bush, at the age of 54, became the 43rd president of the United States, it was only the second time in American history that a president’s son went on to the White House. John Quincy Adams, elected the sixth president in 1824, was the son of John Adams, the second president. While John Adams had groomed his son to be president, George Bush, the 41st president, insisted he was surprised when the eldest of his six children became interested in politics, became governor of Texas, and then went on to the White House. During the early part of the 2000 campaign for the White House, Bush enjoyed a double-digit lead in the polls over his opponent Vice President Al Gore Jr. But the gap closed as the election approached and though Gore finally won the popular vote by 543,895 votes, victory or loss of the presidency hinged on Florida’s electoral votes. That struggle through recounts and lawsuits worked its way to the Supreme Court. In the end Bush won the electoral count 271 to 266. His new administration was focused on “compassionate conservatism,” which embraced excellence in education, tax relief and volunteerism among faith-based and community organizations. Bush was challenged in his re-election bid in 2004 by Massachusetts Democratic Senator John Kerry. The election was a good contest, but Bush’s contention that the invasion of Iraq had made the world more secure against terrorism won the national political debate. Bush was re-elected with 51 percent to 48 percent. On the inaugural stand, George W. Bush set the theme for his second term: “At this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we have seen together. For half a century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. After the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet- and then there came a day of fire. There is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom – tested but not weary… we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom.” The Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from “The Presidents of the United States of America,” by Frank Freidel  and Hugh Sidey.

Lincoln warned the South in his Inaugural Address: ""In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you.... You have no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government, while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve, protect and defend it."" Lincoln thought secession illegal, and was willing to use force to defend Federal law and the Union. When Confederate batteries fired on Fort Sumter and forced its surrender, he called on the states for 75,000 volunteers. Four more slave states joined the Confederacy but four remained within the Union. The Civil War had begun. The son of a Kentucky frontiersman, Lincoln had to struggle for a living and for learning. Five months before receiving his party's nomination for President, he sketched his life: ""I was born Feb. 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished families--second families, perhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth year, was of a family of the name of Hanks.... My father ... removed from Kentucky to ... Indiana, in my eighth year.... It was a wild region, with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods. There I grew up.... Of course when I came of age I did not know much. Still somehow, I could read, write, and cipher ... but that was all."" Lincoln made extraordinary efforts to attain knowledge while working on a farm, splitting rails for fences, and keeping store at New Salem, Illinois. He was a captain in the Black Hawk War, spent eight years in the Illinois legislature, and rode the circuit of courts for many years. His law partner said of him, ""His ambition was a little engine that knew no rest."" He married Mary Todd, and they had four boys, only one of whom lived to maturity. In 1858 Lincoln ran against Stephen A. Douglas for Senator. He lost the election, but in debating with Douglas he gained a national reputation that won him the Republican nomination for President in 1860. As President, he built the Republican Party into a strong national organization. Further, he rallied most of the northern Democrats to the Union cause. On January 1, 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation that declared forever free those slaves within the Confederacy. Lincoln never let the world forget that the Civil War involved an even larger issue. This he stated most movingly in dedicating the military cemetery at Gettysburg: ""that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."" Lincoln won re-election in 1864, as Union military triumphs heralded an end to the war. In his planning for peace, the President was flexible and generous, encouraging Southerners to lay down their arms and join speedily in reunion. The spirit that guided him was clearly that of his Second Inaugural Address, now inscribed on one wall of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D. C.: ""With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds.... "" On Good Friday, April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated at Ford's Theatre in Washington by John Wilkes Booth, an actor, who somehow thought he was helping the South. The opposite was the result, for with Lincoln's death, the possibility of peace with magnanimity died.

Fascinated by history and preservation, in 1890 she helped found the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) serving as its first President General. The centennial of President Washington's inauguration heightened the nation's interest in its heroic past, and in 1890 Caroline Scott Harrison lent her prestige as First Lady to the founding of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She served as its first President General. She took a special interest in the history of the White House, and the mature dignity with which she carried out her duties may overshadow the fun-loving nature that had charmed ""Ben"" Harrison when they met as teenagers. Born at Oxford, Ohio, in 1832, ""Carrie"" was the second daughter of Mary Potts Neal and the Reverend Dr. John W. Scott, a Presbyterian minister and founder of the Oxford Female Institute. As her father's pupil--brown-haired, petite, witty--she infatuated the reserved young Ben, then an honor student at Miami University; they were engaged before his graduation and married in 1853. After early years of struggle while he established a law practice in Indianapolis, they enjoyed a happy family life interrupted only by the Civil War. Then, while General Harrison became a man of note in his profession, his wife cared for their son and daughter, gave active service to the First Presbyterian Church and to an orphans' home, and extended cordial hospitality to her many friends. Church views to the contrary, she saw no harm in private dancing lessons for her daughter--she liked dancing herself. Blessed with considerable artistic talent, she was an accomplished pianist; she especially enjoyed painting for recreation. Illness repeatedly kept her away from Washington's winter social season during her husband's term in the Senate, 1881-1887, and she welcomed their return to private life; but she moved with poise to the White House in 1889 to continue the gracious way of life she had always created in her own home. During the administration the Harrisons' daughter, Mary Harrison McKee, her two children, and other relatives lived at the White House. The First Lady tried in vain to have the overcrowded mansion enlarged but managed to assure an extensive renovation with up-to-date improvements. She established the collection of china associated with White House history. She worked for local charities as well. With other ladies of progressive views, she helped raise funds for the Johns Hopkins University medical school on condition that it admit women. She gave elegant receptions and dinners. In the winter of 1891-1892, however, she had to battle illness as she tried to fulfill her social obligations. She died of tuberculosis at the White House in October 1892, and after services in the East Room was buried from her own church in Indianapolis. When official mourning ended, Mrs. McKee acted as hostess for her father in the last months of his term. (In 1896 he married his first wife's widowed niece and former secretary, Mary Scott Lord Dimmick; she survived him by nearly 47 years, dying in January 1948.)

Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States.  The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.      In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles.  The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law.  In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including ""honor"" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation.      Sec. 2.  Policy.  It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes.      Sec. 3.  Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.      (b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order.  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence.      (c)  To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas).      (d)  Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60 days of notification.      (e)  After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs.      (f)  At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment.      (g)  Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.      (h)  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order.      Sec. 4.  Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs.  (a)  The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant's ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States.      (b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order.      Sec. 5.  Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days.  During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures.  Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures.  Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.      (b)  Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.  Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization.      (c)  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.      (d)  Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest.      (e)  Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest -- including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship -- and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States.      (f)  The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order.      (g)  It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees.  To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.      Sec. 6.  Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility.  The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda.      Sec. 7.  Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System.  (a)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.      (b)  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section.  The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order.  Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.      Sec. 8.  Visa Interview Security.  (a)  The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1222, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions.      (b)  To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.      Sec. 9.  Visa Validity Reciprocity.  The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment.  If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable.      Sec. 10.  Transparency and Data Collection.  (a)  To be more transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter: (i)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; (ii)   information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and (iii)  information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and (iv)   any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.      (b)  The Secretary of State shall, within one year of the date of this order, provide a report on the estimated long-term costs of the USRAP at the Federal, State, and local levels.      Sec. 11.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.      (b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.      (c)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

EST THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good evening.  Please be seated. On behalf of the President of the United States, it will be my great privilege tonight to administer the oath of office to the next Director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney.  (Applause.)  Grateful to be joined by family and friends, but most especially grateful to be joined by Pam Mulvaney.  Pam, thank you for being here and thank you for your family’s commitment to the United States in this new chapter. We also have with us a distinguished group of guests.  Senator Mike Enzi, chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget, is with us today.  Mr. Chairman, thank you for being with us today. Senator Ron Johnson, also on the budget committee.  And the Congressman’s good friends Senator Tom Cotton, Representative Mark Meadows, Representative Justin Amash, and of course, his fellow South Carolinians -- Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott and Representative Joe Wilson.  That's quite a turnout, and I know it means the world to the President, as it does to our new director.  Give all these members a round of applause.  (Applause.)  In Congressman Mick Mulvaney, President Trump has nominated someone with an extraordinary record in public and private life.  He once described himself as a serial entrepreneur, starting no fewer than four businesses over the course of his life.  And along the way, he established himself as a principled, results-driven leader.  And he’ll be bringing those leadership qualities and his well-earned reputation for fiscal responsibility to his new role leading the Office of Management and Budget. These qualities have served him well in public office.  In 2006, he won a seat in South Carolina’s House of Representatives, followed two years later by a seat in the state senate.  Two years after that, he ran for the United States Congress on a promise of faithfully serving the good people of the Palmetto State.  I had the great pleasure of knowing Congressman Mulvaney as a member of Congress, and I couldn’t be more enthusiastic at the President’s decision to task him to lead this vitally important agency and our national budget.  He quickly established himself in the Congress, as I saw firsthand, as one of the leading fiscal experts on Capitol Hill.  He work on the House committees on financial services, oversight, and government reform only added to that sterling reputation.  A happy warrior on behalf of fiscal responsibility, Mick Mulvaney will bring those very same qualities to the Office of Management and Budget. Mick, President Trump has asked you to lead the Office of Management and Budget, a vital role in a day and age of deficits and debt.  And we're both very confident that your leadership, your integrity, and your commitment to protecting America’s fiscal and economic future will serve all the people of the United States with great distinction.  Thank you for stepping up at this time in the life of our nation.  And behalf of President Trump, it now is my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office. (The oath is administered.)  (Applause.)  END 6:47 P.M.

Policy.

That report, and all subsequent reports, shall identify any laws, treaties, regulations, guidance, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and other Government policies that inhibit Federal regulation of the United States financial system in a manner consistent with the Core Principles.

(a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Police departments, libraries, and schools — not to mention driver's licenses and parking tickets — usually fall under the oversight of state and local governments. Each state has its own written constitution, and these documents are often far more elaborate than their federal counterpart. The Alabama Constitution, for example, contains 310,296 words — more than 40 times as many as the U.S. Constitution. State Government Under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, all powers not granted to the federal government are reserved for the states and the people. All state governments are modeled after the federal government and consist of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The U.S. Constitution mandates that all states uphold a ""republican form"" of government, although the three-branch structure is not required. Executive Branch In every state, the executive branch is headed by a governor who is directly elected by the people. In most states, the other leaders in the executive branch are also directly elected, including the lieutenant governor, the attorney general, the secretary of state, and auditors and commissioners. States reserve the right to organize in any way, so they often vary greatly with regard to executive structure. No two state executive organizations are identical. Legislative Branch All 50 states have legislatures made up of elected representatives, who consider matters brought forth by the governor or introduced by its members to create legislation that becomes law. The legislature also approves a state's budget and initiates tax legislation and articles of impeachment. The latter is part of a system of checks and balances among the three branches of government that mirrors the federal system and prevents any branch from abusing its power. Except for one state, Nebraska, all states have a bicameral legislature made up of two chambers: a smaller upper house and a larger lower house. Together the two chambers make state laws and fulfill other governing responsibilities. (Nebraska is the lone state that has just one chamber in its legislature.) The smaller upper chamber is always called the Senate, and its members generally serve longer terms, usually four years. The larger lower chamber is most often called the House of Representatives, but some states call it the Assembly or the House of Delegates. Its members usually serve shorter terms, often two years. Judicial Branch State judicial branches are usually led by the state supreme court, which hears appeals from lower-level state courts. Court structures and judicial appointments/elections are determined either by legislation or the state constitution. The Supreme Court focuses on correcting errors made in lower courts and therefore holds no trials. Rulings made in state supreme courts are normally binding; however, when questions are raised regarding consistency with the U.S. Constitution, matters may be appealed directly to the United States Supreme Court. Local Government Local governments generally include two tiers: counties, also known as boroughs in Alaska and parishes in Louisiana, and municipalities, or cities/towns. In some states, counties are divided into townships. Municipalities can be structured in many ways, as defined by state constitutions, and are called, variously, townships, villages, boroughs, cities, or towns. Various kinds of districts also provide functions in local government outside county or municipal boundaries, such as school districts or fire protection districts. Municipal governments — those defined as cities, towns, boroughs (except in Alaska), villages, and townships — are generally organized around a population center and in most cases correspond to the geographical designations used by the United States Census Bureau for reporting of housing and population statistics. Municipalities vary greatly in size, from the millions of residents of New York City and Los Angeles to the 287 people who live in Jenkins, Minnesota. Municipalities generally take responsibility for parks and recreation services, police and fire departments, housing services, emergency medical services, municipal courts, transportation services (including public transportation), and public works (streets, sewers, snow removal, signage, and so forth). Whereas the federal government and state governments share power in countless ways, a local government must be granted power by the state. In general, mayors, city councils, and other governing bodies are directly elected by the people.   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

Chuck Grassley “We will keep our word” and put Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was an intellectual giant and a revered defender of the Constitution and the limited role of the judiciary in our Republic. His contributions to the court and to broader judicial philosophy will endure for years. Now, we’ll keep our word to the American people to consider a nominee by the new president. … The nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalia’s seat is the product of the most transparent and democratic judicial nomination process in recent history. On the campaign trail, candidate Donald Trump’s list of 21 potential nominees for the vacancy provided rare insight into who could be the next justice in a Trump presidency. The vacancy was on the minds of many voters as they elected Trump to be our next president. According to the Pew Research Center, 65% of voters considered the vacancy very important as they went to the polls. Prior to the president’s announcement, the minority leader called on him to nominate a “mainstream” candidate. There can be no serious debate that Judge Gorsuch meets that standard. He’s been praised by legal experts across the political spectrum as a mainstream jurist who applies the law without regard to person, politics or his own preferences. President Obama’s former solicitor general called him “one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.” That’s high praise. In 2006 Judge Gorsuch sailed through the Senate with unanimous approval. Thirty-one sitting senators were in the Senate when Gorsuch was confirmed, including 12 Democrats. Nonetheless, we have promised a rigorous and thorough review of this nominee, and that’s what we’ll do. The committee will follow the established confirmation timeline for modern Supreme Court vacancies, with a hearing roughly six weeks after the initial nomination. That is more than sufficient time for senators to review his record. … Unfortunately, some Senate Democrats signaled plans to block any nomination made by the newly-elected president even before he announced his nomination. They’re doing so after criticizing Republicans for taking a principled position about a lame duck president that was advocated by Democrats for decades. … Instead, we will keep our word and we will fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Read the entire article here.

When she died before his inauguration as President in 1829, the duties of First Lady fell to her niece, Emily Donelson. Wearing the white dress she had purchased for her husband's inaugural ceremonies in March 1829, Rachel Donelson Jackson was buried in the garden at The Hermitage, her home near Nashville, Tennessee, on Christmas Eve in 1828. Lines from her epitaph--""A being so gentle and so virtuous slander might wound, but could not dishonor""--reflected his bitterness at campaign slurs that seemed to precipitate her death. Rachel Donelson was a child of the frontier. Born in Virginia, she journeyed to the Tennessee wilderness with her parents when only 12. At 17, while living in Kentucky, she married Lewis Robards, of a prominent Mercer County family. His unreasoning jealousy made it impossible for her to live with him; in 1790 they separated, and she heard that he was filing a petition for divorce. Andrew Jackson married her in 1791; and after two happy years they learned to their dismay that Robards had not obtained a divorce, only permission to file for one. Now he brought suit on grounds of adultery. After the divorce was granted, the Jacksons quietly remarried in 1794. They had made an honest mistake, as friends well understood, but whispers of adultery and bigamy followed Rachel as Jackson's career advanced in both politics and war. He was quick to take offense at, and ready to avenge, any slight to her. Scandal aside, Rachel's unpretentious kindness won the respect of all who knew her--including innumerable visitors who found a comfortable welcome at The Hermitage. Although the Jacksons never had children of their own, they gladly opened their home to the children of Rachel's many relatives. In 1809 they adopted a nephew and named him Andrew Jackson, Jr. They also reared other nephews; one, Andrew Jackson Donelson, eventually married his cousin Emily, one of Rachel's favorite nieces. When Jackson was elected President, he planned to have young Donelson for private secretary, with Emily as company for Rachel. After losing his beloved wife he asked Emily to serve as his hostess. Though only 21 when she entered the White House, she skillfully cared for her uncle, her husband, four children (three born at the mansion), many visiting relatives, and official guests. Praised by contemporaries for her wonderful tact, she had the courage to differ with the President on issues of principle. Frail throughout her lifetime, Emily died of tuberculosis in 1836. During the last months of the administration, Sarah Yorke Jackson, wife of Andrew Jackson, Jr., presided at the mansion in her stead.

Policy. In accordance with Executive Order 11423 of August 16, 1968, as amended, and Executive Order 13337 of April 30, 2004, the Secretary of State has delegated authority to receive applications for Presidential permits for the construction, connection, operation, or maintenance, at the borders of the United States, of facilities for the exportation or importation of petroleum, petroleum products, coal, or other fuels to or from a foreign country, and to issue or deny such Presidential permits. As set forth in those Executive Orders, the Secretary of State should issue a Presidential permit for any cross-border pipeline project that ""would serve the national interest."" Accordingly, pursuant to the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct as follows: Sec. 2. Invitation to Submit an Application. I hereby invite TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. (TransCanada), to promptly re-submit its application to the Department of State for a Presidential permit for the construction and operation of the Keystone XL Pipeline, a major pipeline for the importation of petroleum from Canada to the United States. Sec. 3. Directives. (a) Department of State.

Purpose. Infrastructure investment strengthens our economic platform, makes America more competitive, creates millions of jobs, increases wages for American workers, and reduces the costs of goods and services for American families and consumers. Too often, infrastructure projects in the United States have been routinely and excessively delayed by agency processes and procedures. These delays have increased project costs and blocked the American people from the full benefits of increased infrastructure investments, which are important to allowing Americans to compete and win on the world economic stage. Federal infrastructure decisions should be accomplished with maximum efficiency and effectiveness, while also respecting property rights and protecting public safety and the environment. To that end, it is the policy of the executive branch to streamline and expedite, in a manner consistent with law, environmental reviews and approvals for all infrastructure projects, especially projects that are a high priority for the Nation, such as improving the U.S. electric grid and telecommunications systems and repairing and upgrading critical port facilities, airports, pipelines, bridges, and highways. Sec. 2. Identification of High Priority Infrastructure Projects. With respect to infrastructure projects for which Federal reviews and approvals are required, upon request by the Governor of a State, or the head of any executive department or agency (agency), or on his or her own initiative, the Chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall, within 30 days after a request is made, decide whether an infrastructure project qualifies as a ""high priority"" infrastructure project. This determination shall be made after consideration of the project's importance to the general welfare, value to the Nation, environmental benefits, and such other factors as the Chairman deems relevant. Sec. 3. Deadlines. With respect to any project designated as a high priority under section 2 of this order, the Chairman of the CEQ shall coordinate with the head of the relevant agency to establish, in a manner consistent with law, expedited procedures and deadlines for completion of environmental reviews and approvals for such projects. All agencies shall give highest priority to completing such reviews and approvals by the established deadlines using all necessary and appropriate means. With respect to deadlines established consistent with this section that are not met, the head of the relevant agency shall provide a written explanation to the Chairman explaining the causes for the delay and providing concrete actions taken by the agency to complete such reviews and approvals as expeditiously as possible. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (c) All actions taken pursuant to this order shall be consistent with requirements and authorities to protect intelligence and law enforcement sources and methods. Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to supersede measures established under authority of law to protect the security and integrity of specific activities and associations that are in direct support of intelligence and law enforcement operations. (d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Brady Press Briefing Room 5:39 P.M. EST MR. SPICER:  Good evening.  Thank you guys for coming.  I know our first official press briefing is going to be on Monday, but I wanted to give you a few updates on the President's activities.  But before I get to the news of the day, I think I'd like to discuss a little bit of the coverage of the last 24 hours.  Yesterday, at a time when our nation and the world was watching the peaceful transition of power and, as the President said, the transition and the balance of power from Washington to the citizens of the United States, some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting.  For all the talk about the proper use of Twitter, two instances yesterday stand out.  One was a particular egregious example in which a reporter falsely tweeted out that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office.  After it was pointed out that this was just plain wrong, the reporter casually reported and tweeted out and tried to claim that a Secret Service agent must have just been standing in front of it.  This was irresponsible and reckless.  Secondly, photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way, in one particular tweet, to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall.  This was the first time in our nation's history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall.  That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.  This was also the first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past. Inaccurate numbers involving crowd size were also tweeted.  No one had numbers, because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out.  By the way, this applies to any attempts to try to count the number of protestors today in the same fashion. We do know a few things, so let's go through the facts.  We know that from the platform where the President was sworn in, to 4th Street, it holds about 250,000 people.  From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220,000.  And from the media tent to the Washington Monument, another 250,000 people.  All of this space was full when the President took the Oath of Office.  We know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama's last inaugural.  This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration -- period -- both in person and around the globe.  Even the New York Times printed a photograph showing a misrepresentation of the crowd in the original Tweet in their paper, which showed the full extent of the support, depth in crowd, and intensity that existed. These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong.  The President was also at the -- as you know, the President was also at the Central Intelligence Agency and greeted by a raucous overflow crowd of some 400-plus CIA employees.  There were over 1,000 requests to attend, prompting the President to note that he'll have to come back to greet the rest.  The employees were ecstatic that he's the new Commander-in-Chief, and he delivered them a powerful and important message.  He told them he has their back, and they were grateful for that.  They gave him a five-minute standing ovation at the end in a display of their patriotism and their enthusiasm for his presidency.  I'd also note that it's a shame that the CIA didn’t have a CIA Director to be with him today when he visited, because the Democrats have chosen -- Senate Democrats are stalling the nomination of Mike Pompeo and playing politics with national security.  That's what you guys should be writing and covering, instead of sowing division about tweets and false narratives. The President is committed to unifying our country, and that was the focus of his inaugural address.  This kind of dishonesty in the media, the challenging -- that bringing about our nation together is making it more difficult. There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable.  And I'm here to tell you that it goes two ways.  We're going to hold the press accountable, as well.  The American people deserve better.  And as long as he serves as the messenger for this incredible movement, he will take his message directly to the American people where his focus will always be. And with that, a few other updates from the day.  The President had a constructive conversation with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada about strengthening the relationship between our two nations.  They also discussed setting up additional meetings in the days to come, which we will follow up on.  He also spoke to Prime Minister Peña Nieto of Mexico, and talked about a visit on trade, immigration and security that will occur on the 31st.  The President will welcome his first foreign leader this Thursday when the United Kingdom's Theresa May will come to Washington -- on Friday.  Tomorrow, the President will oversee his Assistants to the President being sworn in.  The staff will then have an ethics briefing, a briefing on the proper use and handling of classified information.  Further updates as far as what he will do -- oh, and then in the evening, he will have a reception for law enforcement and first responders that helped support the inauguration.  Thank you guys for being here tonight.  I will see you on Monday.

She served as First Lady from 1981 to 1989, remembered for her passionate advocacy for decreasing drug and alcohol abuse. ""My life really began when I married my husband,"" says Nancy Reagan, who in the 1950's happily gave up an acting career for a permanent role as the wife of Ronald Reagan and mother to their children. Her story actually begins in New York City, her birthplace. She was born on July 6, 1921. When the future First Lady was six, her mother, Edith--a stage actress--married Dr. Loyal Davis, a neurosurgeon. Dr. Davis adopted Nancy, and she grew up in Chicago. It was a happy time: summer camp, tennis, swimming, dancing. She received her formal education at Girls' Latin School and at Smith College in Massachusetts, where she majored in theater. Soon after graduation she became a professional actress. She toured with a road company, then landed a role on Broadway in the hit musical Lute Song. More parts followed. One performance drew an offer from Hollywood. Billed as Nancy Davis, she performed in 11 films from 1949 to 1956. Her first screen role was in Shadow on the Wall. Other releases included The Next Voice Your Hear and East Side, West Side. In her last movie, Hellcats of the Navy, she played opposite her husband. She had met Ronald Reagan in 1951, when he was president of the Screen Actors Guild. The following year they were married in a simple ceremony in Los Angeles in the Little Brown Church in the Valley. Mrs. Reagan soon retired from making movies so she ""could be the wife I wanted to be...A woman's real happiness and real fulfillment come from within the home with her husband and children,"" she says. President and Mrs. Reagan have a daughter, Patricia Ann, and a son, Ronald Prescott. While her husband was Governor of California from 1967 to 1975, she worked with numerous charitable groups. She spent many hours visiting veterans, the elderly, and the emotionally and physically handicapped. These people continued to interest her as First Lady. She gave her support to the Foster Grandparent Program, the subject of her 1982 book, To Love A Child. Increasingly, she has concentrated on the fight against drug and alcohol abuse among young people. She visited prevention and rehabilitation centers, and in 1985 she held a conference at the White House for First Ladies of 17 countries to focus international attention on this problem. Mrs. Reagan shared her lifelong interest in the arts with the nation by using the Executive Mansion as a showcase for talented young performers in the PBS television series ""In Performance at the White House."" In her first year in the mansion she directed a major renovation of the second- and third-floor quarters. Now living in retirement in California, she continues to work on her campaign to teach children to ""just say no"" to drugs. In her book My Turn, published in 1989, she gives her own account of her life in the White House. Through the joys and sorrows of those days, including the assassination attempt on her husband, Nancy Reagan held fast to her belief in love, honesty, and selflessness. ""The ideals have endured because they are right and are no less right today than yesterday.""

EST PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  Prime Minister Abe, on behalf of the American people, I welcome you to the very famous White House.  You honor us with your presence.  This is one of our earliest visits from a foreign leader, and I am truly glad that it could be from such an important and steadfast ally. The bond between our two nations, and the friendship between our two peoples, runs very, very deep.  This administration is committed to bringing those ties even closer.  We are committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control, and to further strengthening our very crucial alliance. The U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific region.  It is important that both Japan and the United States continue to invest very heavily in the alliance to build up our defense and our defensive capabilities, which, under our mutual leadership, will become stronger and stronger, and, as time goes by, ultimately they will be impenetrable.   We face numerous challenges, and bilateral cooperation is essential.  Our country is committed to being an active and fully engaged partner.  We will work together to promote our shared interests, of which we have many in the region, including freedom from navigation and of navigation, and defending against the North Korean missile and nuclear threat, both of which I consider a very, very high priority.  On the economy, we will seek a trading relationship that is free, fair and reciprocal, benefitting both of our countries.  The vibrant exchange between us is a true blessing.  Japan is a proud nation with a rich history and culture, and the American people have profound respect for your country and its traditions.  I also want to take this opportunity, Mr. Prime Minister, to thank you and the people of Japan for hosting our armed forces.  Working together, our two countries have the ability to bring greater harmony, stability and prosperity to the Pacific region and beyond, improving countless lives in the process.  We are committed to that goal -- highly committed.    Prime Minister Abe, on behalf of the United States of America, I thank you for being with us today.  We will soon be traveling to the great state of Florida, where I know we will have a long and very successful talk, negotiations, and a very, very productive weekend. Mr. Prime Minister. PRIME MINISTER ABE:  (As interpreted.)  This is the fourth time in six months for me to visit the United States.  The last time was in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii at the end of last year.  I am indeed sincerely grateful for the always heartwarming welcome accorded to me by the American people.   I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to President Trump.  Donald, you must have been very busy in this very important period of 100 days after your inauguration.  And thank you very much for inviting me over to the White House.  My name is Abe, but in the United States some people mistakenly pronounce my name as ""Abe.""  But that is not bad, because even in Japan everybody knows the name of that great President, that a farmer and carpenter's son can become a President.  And that fact, 150 years ago, surprised the Japanese, who were still under the shogunate rule.  The Japanese opened their eyes to democracy.  The United States is the champion of democracy. Donald, President, you are excellent businessman, but you have never been in the Congress or been a governor.  You have not experienced being in the public office.  But you have fought the uphill struggle and fight for more than a year in the election campaign to become a new President.  And this is the dynamism of democracy.  I would like to celebrate and congratulate Donald being sworn in as the President.   The United States is a country having the largest number of chances, opportunities in the world.  That has always been the case right now, as well as going forward.  This will never change.  And that is the reason why automotive industries and other Japanese businesses have built factories all over the United States, to engage in local production here.  Last year, from Japan to the United States, there have been more than $150 billion of new investment being made into the United States.  And those Japanese businesses have created a large number of jobs.  The mutually beneficial economic relations have been built by Japan and the United States.  With President Trump taking on the leadership, I'm sure there will be -- major-scale infrastructure investment will be made, including the fast-speed train.   Those of you who have rode on the Japanese Shinkansen, I'm sure you would appreciate the speed, the comfort and safety with the latest maglev technology.  From Washington, D.C. to New York, where Trump Tower exists, only one hour would it take if you ride the maglev train from Washington, D.C. to New York.  Japan, with our high level of technical capability, we will be able to contribute to President Trump's growth strategy.  There will be even more new jobs being born in the United States. And to further deepen these bilateral economic relations between Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence, there will be a cross-sectoral dialogue to be held.  And we have agreed on this.   And furthermore, in Asia Pacific, where we see dramatic growth to expand free trade and investment, this will be a big chance for both Japan and the United States.  But, of course, it must be done in a fair manner.  Never should a state-owned company, backed by state capital, should not make any economic intervention.  Free ride on intellectual property should not be condoned.  In Asia Pacific region, with Japan and U.S. taking on the leadership to create free and fair market based upon rules, should be built.  I and President Trump have confirmed on our strong will to do so.   The cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Asia Pacific, that is the strong Japan-U.S. alliance.  And this is unwavering ties between our two countries.  I and President Trump will work together to further strengthen our alliance.  We have shared this strong resolve.   As we see increasingly difficult security environment, we have confirmed that U.S.-Japan Security Pact Article 5 will be applied to Senkaku Islands.  The United States will strengthen its presence in the region.  And under the banner of the proactive contribution to peace, Japan will play a greater role.  At the same time, we will maintain the deterrence and also to proceed on reducing the impact we had fought through on the realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan. And Henoko's -- relocation to Henoko of the impasse Futenma is the only solution.  And Japan and U.S. will continue to work closely on this. On North Korea, we would strongly demand North Korea to abandon nuclear and ballistic missile program, and not to make any more provocations.  And we have completely agreed on the importance of the early solution for the abduction issue in East China Sea, South China Sea, and Indian Ocean -- everywhere we need to maintain the freedom of navigation and rule of law.  And such international order there must be maintained. Japan and United States have confirmed that we will strongly protest any use of force, as well as coercion to change the status quo.  I and the President will address not only bilateral but regional issues.  And we have had a very frank exchange of views on the peace and prosperity of the world that we should contribute, for any form of terrorism should be strongly condemned.  And we will cooperate in our fight against terrorism.  Japan will, of course, exercise a commensurate role in this regard.  And furthermore, the regional conflict of the refugees, of poverty and infectious diseases -- there are many challenges faced by the world, which will be a serious issue to threaten the peace and stability for Japan as well as the United States. But Japan and the United States and the international community must work hand in hand in order to solve these questions.  Of course, there are disagreements, but we should not close down dialogue just by pointing to the differences and ignoring the common interests and common goals.  We need to have dialogue because there are disagreements.  What we mostly desire -- what is most desired by those who are challenging the existing international order is to just focus on differences.  We should not close the dialogue of Japan -- have for four years that I have consistently followed through on our foreign policy.   Now, whatever the challenge and difficulty ahead of us, I and Trump -- President Trump will continue our dialogue to seek shared solutions.  And after lunch, I am looking forward for a weekend in Florida with Donald.  We will play golf together.  My scores in golf is not up to the level of Donald at all, but my policy is never up, never in, always aiming for the cup -- never cut to just the goal with shortcuts and short chops.  Those are the words never found in my dictionary.  (Laughter.)  But in a relaxed atmosphere, I hope to take time to discuss with Donald on the future of the world, future of the region, and future of Japan and the United States.   Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you very much.  We’ll take a few questions, unless you don’t want to ask any questions, if that’s possible.  Maybe we’ll start -- where is Daniel Halper, New York Post?  Daniel.   Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I’m curious about yesterday’s ruling in the 9th Circuit Court.  Has it caused you to rethink your use of executive power?  And how will you respond?  And will you sign new executive orders and perhaps a new travel ban? And, Mr. Prime Minister, I’m curious about your reaction to America’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP.  Do you think that that’s weakened America’s position in Asia?  And how do you think -- how do you envision any sort of trade deal with the President working out? PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Well, your question was unrelated to what we’re here for today, but I’ll answer it.  We are going to keep our country safe, we are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe.  We had a decision which we think we’ll be very successful with.  It shouldn’t have taken this much time because safety is a primary reason.  One of the reasons I’m standing here today is the security of our country.  The voters felt that I would give it the best security.  So we’ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country.  You’ll be seeing that sometime next week.  In addition, we will continue to go through the court process, and ultimately I have no doubt that we’ll win that particular case. PRIME MINISTER ABE:  (As interpreted.)  Now, in the world, we are also facing the issues of the refugees and terrorism.  We need to work closely together on these global issues.  Japan have always played our own role, but going forward, we will continue to work with the international community to execute our responsibility in a commensurate manner.  And each of our country has immigration control scheme, as well as policy on immigration, as well as refugees.  These are to do with domestic affairs of that country, so I would refrain from making any comments. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Okay.  Blake Berman, Fox.  Blake Berman. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I’d like to pick up where Daniel left off, if you don’t mind.  You said earlier this week -- and I’m quoting for you -- you said, ""I’ve learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand, but we’re going to take care of it.""   Based off of what you have learned, and now knowing that your executive order is at least temporarily on hold, do you still feel as confident now as you have been at any point, that you and the administration will be able to protect the homeland? And, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you.  I would just like to pick off again on what Daniel had asked about TPP.  Do you feel it’s a mistake that the United States has at least signaled its intention to withdraw from the deal?  Thank you, both. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I feel totally confident that we will have tremendous security for the people of the United States.  We will be extreme vetting, which is a term that I developed early in my campaign because I saw what was happening.  And while I’ve been President, which is just for a very short period of time, I’ve learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely, President.  And there are tremendous threats to our country.  We will not allow that to happen, I can tell you that right now.  We will not allow that to happen.   So we’ll be going forward.  We’ll be doing things to continue to make our country safe.  It will happen rapidly.  And we will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people.  We will allow lots of people into our country that will love our people and do good for our country.  It’s always going to be that way, at least during my administration, I can tell you that. PRIME MINISTER ABE:  (As interpreted.)  On TPP -- oh, of course, we are fully aware of President Trump’s decision.  On economic issues, we will be discussing at the working lunch to follow.  As for Japan and United States, trade and investment, as well as economic relations, how can we develop and grow our relationship.  As I have already mentioned, Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence will create a new framework for dialogue, and I am quite optimistic that the good results will be seen from the dialogue. Now, for the free and fair common set of rules to be created for the free trade regime in the region, and that was the purpose of TPP, and that importance have not changed.  I, myself, believe that. Q    (As interpreted.)  Thank you.  My name is Hara from NHK.  I have a question to Prime Minister Abe.  Now, for the automotive market in Japan, as well as foreign exchange of Japan, in the prior remarks there have been discrepancy in your positions.  So at the summit meeting, what were the discussions?   And were you able to narrow down the gap? And President Trump had said that he will make the United States a great country.  What is meant by the “great country”?  And, Prime Minister, what do you mean when you say United States is a great ally for you? PRIME MINISTER ABE:  Now with the birth of the Trump administration, a new genesis will be built between Japan and U.S. in economic relations.  In order to put forward such strong message, I have proposed to launch a new framework for economic dialogue, and we were able to agree on this. As for sectoral discussions, we will be having a discussion at our working lunch.  In any case, between President Trump and I, myself, on Japan and U.S. economic relations, we will -- we have already agreed that we will have Vice President Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Aso to discuss fully on the economic relations between our two countries.  And we are looking forward for the good results to ensue from the debate between the experts.   As for the foreign exchange, we will have -- Secretary of Treasury and the Minister of Finance will continue the close communication. For the United States to become a great nation, the various roles played by the United States and the responsibility to go with it, the world over is faced with increasing uncertainty.  That United States will become a great America and become a great and strong ally would be good for Japan.  And for Japan and U.S. alliance to be further strengthened would be good not only for our two nations, but also contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Asia Pacific and United States to become even greater.  We will welcome that. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Thank you.  I will say that -- and you've seen it -- ever since I won the election and became President-elect, I’ve been telling companies, car companies and other companies -- many companies:  Come back into the United States.  And they've been coming back in.  And big announcements are going to be made over the next short period of time.  Some of you already know what those announcements are. We lost a lot of our factories, a lot of our plants.  And those factories and those plants will be coming back.  And jobs will be coming back to Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and so many other places where we've lost so many jobs.  And those are the people that were so good to me, and now I’m being good to them.   So we've had a tremendous number of announcements.  We've had Ford and General Motors and many, many others -- Intel yesterday made a major announcement.  And they did that because of what is happening with our tax structure, which is going along very well.  And we’ll be having some very big news over the next short period of time. But we are a nation of tremendous potential.  And the expression “Make America Great Again,” I will tell you -- and I will add very strongly and with great assurance, it will be greater than ever before. And I just want to thank the Prime Minister for a friendship.  We developed a great friendship when we met in New York City, at Trump Tower.  We spoke for a long, long period of time.  And when I greeted him today at the car, I was saying -- I shook hands, but I grabbed him and hugged him because that's the way we feel.  We have a very, very good bond -- very, very good chemistry.  I’ll let you know if it changes, but I don't think it will.  (Laughter.)   So I just want to thank the Prime Minister for being here.  We're going to be meeting your wife in a very short period of time, and I look very much forward to that.   And I want to thank everybody in the room.  We're going to have a tremendous relationship, long-term relationship of mutual benefit with Japan. Thank you all very much.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.   PRIME MINISTER ABE:  One more. PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Yes, certainly.  Go ahead. Q    (As interpreted.)  Thank you very much.  From Sankei Shimbun, my name is Takita.  I have a question to President Trump.  Obama administration, under the rebalance to Asia, have emphasized Asia.  But China is taking hardline stance in South China Sea, as well as China Sea.  And North Korea has went on with the missiles and nuclear development.  So some countries in Asia are concerned over commitment of United States in Asia.  So against this backdrop, as was mentioned earlier, for the Trump administration, for the situations in Asia, how would you respond to the increasing difficulty here? And, President, you have repeatedly stated about China taking on the currency -- foreign exchange policies which are not good for the United States.  Do you think that eventually it will change in the future? PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I had a very, very good conversation, as most of you know, yesterday with the President of China.  It was a very, very warm conversation.  I think we are on the process of getting along very well.  And I think that will also be very much of a benefit to Japan.  So we had a very, very good talk last night and discussed a lot of subjects.  It was a long talk.  And we are working on that as we speak.  We have conversations with various representatives of China, I believe, that that will all work out very well for everybody -- China, Japan, the United States, and everybody in the region. As far as the currency devaluations, I’ve been complaining about that for a long time.  And I believe that we will all eventually -- and probably very much sooner than a lot of people understand or think -- we will be all at a level playing field, because that's the only way it’s fair.  That's the only way that you can fairly compete in trade and other things.  And we will be on that field, and we will all be working very hard to do great for our country.  But it has to be fair.  And we will make it fair.   I think the United States is going to be an even bigger player than it is right now, by a lot, when it comes to trade.   A lot of that will have to do with our tax policy, which you’ll be seeing in the not-too-distant future.  We’ll have an incentive-based policy much more so than we have right now.  Right now we don't even know -- nobody knows what policy we have.  But we're going to have a very much incentive-based policy.  We're working with Congress, working with Paul Ryan, working with Mitch McConnell.  And I think people are going to be very, very impressed.  We're also working very much -- and this has a lot to do with business -- on health care, where we can get great health care for our country at a much-reduced price, both to the people receiving the health care and to our country.  Because our country is paying so much, and Obamacare, as you know, is a total and complete disaster.  So we’re going to end up with tremendous health care at a lower price.  And I think people are going to be extremely happy.  Difficult process, but once we get going -- and, as you know, Tom Price was just approved a few hours ago.  So we finally have our Secretary, and now we get down to the final strokes. Again, I want to thank everybody for being here.  I want to thank Mr. Prime Minister.  What an honor, what a great honor it is.  And let’s go to Florida. (Applause.)     END  1:37 P.M.

Trump Vice President Mike Pence First Lady Melania Trump Mrs. Karen Pence The Cabinet Mrs. Karen Pence As Second Lady of the United States, Karen Pence works to bring attention to issues facing children and families by shining the spotlight on the mental health profession of art therapy. Art therapy is facilitated by art therapists who use art media as a method of treatment for people experiencing developmental, medical, educational, and social or psychological impairment. Those who benefit from art therapy include individuals who have survived trauma resulting from combat, abuse, and natural disaster; people with adverse physical health conditions such as cancer, traumatic brain injury, and other health disability; and individuals with autism, dementia, depression, and other disorders. Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence, devoted 25 years in the classroom as an elementary school teacher before becoming the First Lady of Indiana on January 14, 2013 when her husband was sworn in as the 50th Governor.  As Second Lady, Mrs. Pence will continue to bring attention to children and art therapy programs. Mrs. Pence is an artist and her specialty is watercolors of homes and historical buildings. She was the honorary chair of the Art Therapy Initiative at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health in Indianapolis and is a member of Riley Children’s Foundation.  She also serves as a board member for Tracy’s Kids, an art therapy program for several children’s hospitals in the Washington, D.C. area.  She has observed art therapy programs in Israel, Canada, Japan, and Germany.  Mrs. Pence also traveled throughout Indiana as the state’s official Bicentennial Ambassador. In this position, she played a key role in celebrating Indiana’s 200th birthday in 2016. In her role as First Lady of Indiana, Mrs. Pence created the Indiana First Lady’s Charitable Foundation.  The Foundation was a 501 (c) 3, established with the purpose to encourage and support youth and families of Indiana.  The beneficiaries include individuals, schools, communities, and families, along with arts organizations.  The Foundation’s board awarded over $600,000 in grants to charities serving Hoosiers in all 92 counties. Mrs. Pence brought awareness to many causes by supporting and participating in over 40 initiatives as First Lady of Indiana. Mrs. Pence earned a B.S. and M.S. in Elementary Education from Butler University in Indianapolis. She is a Blue Star mom with a son in the United States Marine Corps.  Mrs. Pence and Vice President Mike Pence have been married since 1985 and are proud parents of their adult children, Michael and his wife Sarah, and daughters Charlotte and Audrey.  Follow Mrs. Pence on Twitter at @SecondLady.

Learn more about the powers of the Legislative Branch of the federal government of the United States. Established by Article I of the Constitution, the Legislative Branch consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate, which together form the United States Congress. The Constitution grants Congress the sole authority to enact legislation and declare war, the right to confirm or reject many Presidential appointments, and substantial investigative powers. The House of Representatives is made up of 435 elected members, divided among the 50 states in proportion to their total population. In addition, there are 6 non-voting members, representing the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and four other territories of the United States. The presiding officer of the chamber is the Speaker of the House, elected by the Representatives. He or she is third in the line of succession to the Presidency. Members of the House are elected every two years and must be 25 years of age, a U.S. citizen for at least seven years, and a resident of the state (but not necessarily the district) they represent. The House has several powers assigned exclusively to it, including the power to initiate revenue bills, impeach federal officials, and elect the President in the case of an electoral college tie. The Senate is composed of 100 Senators, 2 for each state. Until the ratification of the 17th Amendment in 1913, Senators were chosen by state legislatures, not by popular vote. Since then, they have been elected to six-year terms by the people of each state. Senator's terms are staggered so that about one-third of the Senate is up for reelection every two years. Senators must be 30 years of age, U.S. citizens for at least nine years, and residents of the state they represent. The Vice President of the United States serves as President of the Senate and may cast the decisive vote in the event of a tie in the Senate. The Senate has the sole power to confirm those of the President's appointments that require consent, and to ratify treaties. There are, however, two exceptions to this rule: the House must also approve appointments to the Vice Presidency and any treaty that involves foreign trade. The Senate also tries impeachment cases for federal officials referred to it by the House. In order to pass legislation and send it to the President for his signature, both the House and the Senate must pass the same bill by majority vote. If the President vetoes a bill, they may override his veto by passing the bill again in each chamber with at least two-thirds of each body voting in favor. The Legislative Process The first step in the legislative process is the introduction of a bill to Congress. Anyone can write it, but only members of Congress can introduce legislation. Some important bills are traditionally introduced at the request of the President, such as the annual federal budget. During the legislative process, however, the initial bill can undergo drastic changes. After being introduced, a bill is referred to the appropriate committee for review. There are 17 Senate committees, with 70 subcommittees, and 23 House committees, with 104 subcommittees. The committees are not set in stone, but change in number and form with each new Congress as required for the efficient consideration of legislation. Each committee oversees a specific policy area, and the subcommittees take on more specialized policy areas. For example, the House Committee on Ways and Means includes subcommittees on Social Security and Trade. A bill is first considered in a subcommittee, where it may be accepted, amended, or rejected entirely. If the members of the subcommittee agree to move a bill forward, it is reported to the full committee, where the process is repeated again. Throughout this stage of the process, the committees and subcommittees call hearings to investigate the merits and flaws of the bill. They invite experts, advocates, and opponents to appear before the committee and provide testimony, and can compel people to appear using subpoena power if necessary. If the full committee votes to approve the bill, it is reported to the floor of the House or Senate, and the majority party leadership decides when to place the bill on the calendar for consideration. If a bill is particularly pressing, it may be considered right away. Others may wait for months or never be scheduled at all. When the bill comes up for consideration, the House has a very structured debate process. Each member who wishes to speak only has a few minutes, and the number and kind of amendments are usually limited. In the Senate, debate on most bills is unlimited — Senators may speak to issues other than the bill under consideration during their speeches, and any amendment can be introduced. Senators can use this to filibuster bills under consideration, a procedure by which a Senator delays a vote on a bill — and by extension its passage — by refusing to stand down. A supermajority of 60 Senators can break a filibuster by invoking cloture, or the cession of debate on the bill, and forcing a vote. Once debate is over, the votes of a simple majority passes the bill. A bill must pass both houses of Congress before it goes to the President for consideration. Though the Constitution requires that the two bills have the exact same wording, this rarely happens in practice. To bring the bills into alignment, a Conference Committee is convened, consisting of members from both chambers. The members of the committee produce a conference report, intended as the final version of the bill. Each chamber then votes again to approve the conference report. Depending on where the bill originated, the final text is then enrolled by either the Clerk of the House or the Secretary of the Senate, and presented to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate for their signatures. The bill is then sent to the President. When receiving a bill from Congress, the President has several options. If the President agrees substantially with the bill, he or she may sign it into law, and the bill is then printed in the Statutes at Large. If the President believes the law to be bad policy, he may veto it and send it back to Congress. Congress may override the veto with a two-thirds vote of each chamber, at which point the bill becomes law and is printed. There are two other options that the President may exercise. If Congress is in session and the President takes no action within 10 days, the bill becomes law. If Congress adjourns before 10 days are up and the President takes no action, then the bill dies and Congress may not vote to override. This is called a pocket veto, and if Congress still wants to pass the legislation, they must begin the entire process anew. Powers of Congress Congress, as one of the three coequal branches of government, is ascribed significant powers by the Constitution. All legislative power in the government is vested in Congress, meaning that it is the only part of the government that can make new laws or change existing laws. Executive Branch agencies issue regulations with the full force of law, but these are only under the authority of laws enacted by Congress. The President may veto bills Congress passes, but Congress may also override a veto by a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Article I of the Constitution enumerates the powers of Congress and the specific areas in which it may legislate. Congress is also empowered to enact laws deemed ""necessary and proper"" for the execution of the powers given to any part of the government under the Constitution. Part of Congress's exercise of legislative authority is the establishment of an annual budget for the government. To this end, Congress levies taxes and tariffs to provide funding for essential government services. If enough money cannot be raised to fund the government, then Congress may also authorize borrowing to make up the difference. Congress can also mandate spending on specific items: legislatively directed spending, commonly known as ""earmarks,"" specifies funds for a particular project, rather than for a government agency. Both chambers of Congress have extensive investigative powers, and may compel the production of evidence or testimony toward whatever end they deem necessary. Members of Congress spend much of their time holding hearings and investigations in committee. Refusal to cooperate with a Congressional subpoena can result in charges of contempt of Congress, which could result in a prison term. The Senate maintains several powers to itself: It ratifies treaties by a two-thirds supermajority vote and confirms the appointments of the President by a majority vote. The consent of the House of Representatives is also necessary for the ratification of trade agreements and the confirmation of the Vice President. Congress also holds the sole power to declare war. Government Oversight Oversight of the executive branch is an important Congressional check on the President's power and a balance against his discretion in implementing laws and making regulations. A major way that Congress conducts oversight is through hearings. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs are both devoted to overseeing and reforming government operations, and each committee conducts oversight in its policy area. Congress also maintains an investigative organization, the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Founded in 1921 as the General Accounting Office, its original mission was to audit the budgets and financial statements sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Today, the GAO audits and generates reports on every aspect of the government, ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent with the effectiveness and efficiency that the American people deserve. The executive branch also polices itself: Sixty-four Inspectors General, each responsible for a different agency, regularly audit and report on the agencies to which they are attached.   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

She became First Lady from 1844 to 1845 after their secret engagement and wedding.  ""I grieve my love a belle should be,"" sighed one of Julia Gardiner's innumerable admirers in 1840; at the age of 20 she was already famous as the ""Rose of Long Island."" Daughter of Juliana McLachlan and David Gardiner, descendant of prominent and wealthy New York families, Julia was trained from earliest childhood for a life in society; she made her debut at 15. A European tour with her family gave her new glimpses of social splendors. Late in 1842 the Gardiners went to Washington for the winter social season, and Julia became the undisputed darling of the capital. Her beauty and her practiced charm attracted the most eminent men in the city, among them President Tyler, a widower since September. Tragedy brought his courtship poignant success the next winter. Julia, her sister Margaret, and her father joined a Presidential excursion on the new steam frigate Princeton; and David Gardiner lost his life in the explosion of a huge naval gun. Tyler comforted Julia in her grief and won her consent to a secret engagement. The first President to marry in office took his vows in New York on June 26, 1844. The news was then broken to the American people, who greeted it with keen interest, much publicity, and some criticism about the couple's difference in age: 30 years. As young Mrs. Tyler said herself, she ""reigned"" as First Lady for the last eight months of her husband's term. Wearing white satin or black lace to obey the conventions of mourning, she presided with vivacity and animation at a series of parties. She enjoyed her position immensely, and filled it with grace. For receptions she revived the formality of the Van Buren administration; she welcomed guests with plumes in her hair, attended by maids of honor dressed in white. She once declared, with truth: ""Nothing appears to delight the President more than...to hear people sing my praises."" The Tylers' happiness was unshaken when they retired to their home at Sherwood Forest in Virginia. There Julia bore five of her seven children; and she acted as mistress of the plantation until the Civil War. As such, she defended both states' rights and the institution of slavery. She championed the political views of her husband, who remained for her ""the President"" until the end of his life. His death in 1862 came as a severe blow to her. In a poem composed for his sixty-second birthday she had assured him that ""what e'er changes time may bring, I'll love thee as thou art!"" Even as a refugee in New York, she devoted herself to volunteer work for the Confederacy. Its defeat found her impoverished. Not until 1958 would federal law provide automatic pensions for Presidential widows; but Congress in 1870 voted a pension for Mary Lincoln, and Julia Tyler used this precedent in seeking help. In December 1880 Congress voted her $1,200 a year -- and after Garfield's assassination it passed bills to grant uniform amounts of $5,000 annually to Mrs. Garfield, Mrs. Lincoln, Mrs. Polk, and Mrs. Tyler. Living out her last years comfortably in Richmond, Julia died there in 1889 and was buried there at her husband's side.

She went on to become a U.S. Secretary of State and U.S. Senator from New York. In the 2008 election, Clinton was a leading candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination. During the 1992 presidential campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton observed, ""Our lives are a mixture of different roles. Most of us are doing the best we can to find whatever the right balance is . . . For me, that balance is family, work, and service."" Hillary Diane Rodham, Dorothy and Hugh Rodham's first child, was born on October 26, 1947. Two brothers, Hugh and Tony, soon followed. Hillary's childhood in Park Ridge, Illinois, was happy and disciplined. She loved sports and her church, and was a member of the National Honor Society, and a student leader. Her parents encouraged her to study hard and to pursue any career that interested her. As an undergraduate at Wellesley College, Hillary mixed academic excellence with school government. Speaking at graduation, she said, ""The challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, possible."" In 1969, Hillary entered Yale Law School, where she served on the Board of Editors of Yale Law Review and Social Action, interned with children's advocate Marian Wright Edelman, and met Bill Clinton. The President often recalls how they met in the library when she strode up to him and said, ""If you're going to keep staring at me, I might as well introduce myself."" The two were soon inseparable--partners in moot court, political campaigns, and matters of the heart. After graduation, Hillary advised the Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge and joined the impeachment inquiry staff advising the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives. After completing those responsibilities, she ""followed her heart to Arkansas,"" where Bill had begun his political career. They married in 1975. She joined the faculty of the University of Arkansas Law School in 1975 and the Rose Law Firm in 1976. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the board of the Legal Services Corporation, and Bill Clinton became governor of Arkansas. Their daughter, Chelsea, was born in 1980. Hillary served as Arkansas's First Lady for 12 years, balancing family, law, and public service. She chaired the Arkansas Educational Standards Committee, co-founded the Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, and served on the boards of the Arkansas Children's Hospital, Legal Services, and the Children's Defense Fund. As the nation's First Lady, Hillary continued to balance public service with private life. Her active role began in 1993 when the President asked her to chair the Task Force on National Health Care Reform. She continued to be a leading advocate for expanding health insurance coverage, ensuring children are properly immunized, and raising public awareness of health issues. She wrote a weekly newspaper column entitled ""Talking It Over,"" which focused on her experiences as First Lady and her observations of women, children, and families she has met around the world. Her 1996 book It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children Teach Us was a best seller, and she received a Grammy Award for her recording of it. As First Lady, her public involvement with many activities sometimes led to controversy. Undeterred by critics, Hillary won many admirers for her staunch support for women around the world and her commitment to children's issues. Hillary Clinton was elected United States Senator from New York on November 7, 2000. She is the first First Lady elected to the United States Senate and the first woman elected statewide in New York. Hillary Clinton served as U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.

Mancini, Acting Administrator                 Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs SUBJECT:   Interim Guidance Implementing Section 2 of the Executive Order                       of January 30, 2017, Titled “Reducing Regulation and                       Controlling Regulatory Costs” I. General Requirements This interim guidance, in the form of Questions and Answers (Q&As), addresses the requirements in Section 2, “Regulatory Cap for Fiscal Year 2017,” of the Executive Order of January 30, 2017, titled “Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs” (EO). Specifically, the guidance explains, for purposes of implementing Section 2 in Fiscal Year 2017, the following requirements: ”Unless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency . . . publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed.” Sec. 2(a). “For fiscal year 2017, . . .the heads of all agencies are directed that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero, unless otherwise required by law or consistent with advice provided in writing by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget . . . .” Sec. 2(b). “In furtherance of the requirement of subsection (a) of this section, any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations.” Sec. 2(c). In general, executive departments and agencies (“agencies”) may comply with those requirements by issuing two “deregulatory” actions (described below) for each new significant regulatory action that imposes costs. The savings of the two deregulatory actions are to fully offset the costs of the new significant regulatory action. In addition, beginning immediately, agencies planning to issue one or more significant regulatory action on or before September 30, 2017, should for each such significant regulatory action: A reasonable period of time before the agency issues that action, identify two existing regulatory actions the agency plans to eliminate or propose for elimination on or before September 30, 2017; and Fully offset the total incremental cost of such new significant regulatory action as of September 30, 2017. Please consult with your Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) Desk Officer if you have any particular questions regarding the applicability or interpretation of the EO not addressed in these Q&As. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plans to issue further guidance regarding the application of EO for Fiscal Years 2018 and beyond soon. In addition, OMB may revise these Q&As. Comments on this interim guidance should be provided to reducingregulation@omb.eop.gov by February 10, 2017. II. Coverage Q: Which new regulations are covered? A: The EO’s requirements for Fiscal Year 2017 apply only to those significant regulatory actions, as defined in Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, an agency issues between noon on January 20 and September 30, 2017. This includes significant final regulations for which agencies issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking before noon on January 20, 2017. Significant guidance documents may also be covered (see below). Please continue to follow the standard significance determination process outlined in Executive Order 12866. Regulations that affect only other Federal agencies (and not the public); that are issued with respect to a military, national security, or foreign affairs function of the United States; and that are related to agency organization, management, or personnel are not subject to Section 2’s requirements. Q: What about rules that implement Federal spending programs? A: In general, Federal spending rules that primarily cause income transfers from taxpayers to program beneficiaries (e.g., rules associated with Pell grants and Medicare spending) are considered “transfer rules” and are not covered by this EO. However, in cases where these rules impose requirements on non-Federal entities, such as reporting or recordkeeping, agencies would need to account for these costs. Please consult with your OIRA Desk Officer on these rules. See OMB Circular A-4 for a discussion of the distinction between transfers and costs generally. Q: Do Section 2’s requirements apply to significant regulatory actions of independent agencies? A: No, the requirements of Section 2 apply only to those agencies required to submit significant regulatory actions to OIRA for review under EO 12866. Nevertheless, we encourage independent regulatory agencies to identify existing regulations that, if repealed or revised, would achieve cost savings that would fully offset the costs of new significant regulatory actions. Q: Are new guidance/interpretive documents covered? A: New significant guidance or interpretive documents will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Consult with your OIRA Desk Officer before issuing new significant guidance or regulatory interpretations. Agencies should continue to adhere to OMB’s 2007 Memorandum on Good Guidance Practices. As always, agencies should ensure that such documents are the appropriate vehicle for the particular policy goal, and that it is clear that compliance with any agency guidance is voluntary. Any cost savings claimed for guidance or other documents must be specific and verifiable. Q: Which existing regulatory actions, if repealed or revised, would be considered deregulatory actions, and thus qualify for savings? A: Any existing regulatory action that imposes costs and the repeal or revision of which will produce verifiable savings may qualify. Meaningful burden reduction through the repeal or streamlining of mandatory reporting, recordkeeping or disclosure requirements may also qualify. Agencies should also confirm that they will continue to achieve their regulatory objectives after the deregulatory action is undertaken. Please consult with your OIRA Desk Officer regarding information collections or other actions you believe should qualify as deregulatory actions under Section Q: Do regulatory actions issued before January 20 that are vacated or remanded by a court after that date qualify for savings? A: Generally no, based on the presumption that a court determined these regulatory actions were issued, at least in part, with insufficient legal basis. There may be individual cases, however, where we would consider counting such savings, and specifically request comment on this topic. As one example, the agency may be directed by a court, under remand, to modify a rule through full notice and comment rulemaking, in order address particular issues. Q: Do regulatory actions overturned by subsequently enacted laws qualify for savings? A: Generally yes. We will consider Acts of Congress that overturn final regulatory actions, such as disapprovals of rules under the Congressional Review Act, to operate in a similar manner as agency deregulatory actions for the purposes of the requirements of Section 2 of the EO. III. Accounting Questions Q: How should costs be measured? A: Costs should be measured as the opportunity cost to society. OMB Circular A-4 defines this concept. Q: How should agencies account for deregulatory actions that do not outright repeal existing regulations but revise existing requirements to produce real cost savings? A: OMB will address deregulatory actions that continue to allow agencies to meet regulatory goals on a case-by-case basis. Purely deregulatory actions that confer only savings to all affected parties generally will not trigger the requirement under Section 2(a) for the agency to identify two existing regulatory actions to be repealed. However, if such deregulatory actions impose costs on individuals or entities, agencies will need to offset those costs. Q: Can effects such as future energy cost savings for rules that require the adoption of more energy efficient technologies be counted against the compliance costs of a regulatory action for purposes of Section 2(b) of the EO? A: In most circumstances, such effects would not be counted as offsets to costs according to OIRA’s reporting conventions for benefit-cost analysis. Q: What about costs that occur over different time periods? A: All costs estimates should be annualized in accordance with OMB Circular A-4. While timing issues will be handled on a case-by-case basis, in general, the start and end points for the annualization of costs should be directly comparable across the new and corresponding repealed regulatory actions. Q: Can agencies use previously estimated costs from an original Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIA) in determining the cost savings generated by an eliminated regulatory action? A: In general, no. While the original RIA may have information that will be useful in calculating cost savings, the most current information available on projected cost savings (e.g., new information on the cost of operating compliance technologies) must be included to the extent feasible. Agencies are also strongly encouraged to use program evaluations and similar techniques to determine the actual cost and other effects of eliminating regulatory actions. Q: What costs of existing regulatory actions should be counted as cost savings from a deregulatory action? A: All costs that would have occurred after the effective date of the repeal of the existing regulatory action should be the basis for the cost savings estimate. This means, for example, that agencies should not count sunk costs. Q: How should costs that duplicate those in another regulatory action be addressed? A: In general, costs should be counted only once, in the regulatory action that imposes the legally binding requirement resulting in those costs. Exceptions should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with your OIRA Desk Officer. Q: How should agencies treat unquantified costs and cost savings? A: These will be handled on a case-by-case basis. As a general matter, the weight assigned to unquantified effects will depend on their significance and degree of certainty. See OMB Circular A-4 for more information on unquantified costs. IV. Process and Waiver Questions Q: Which significant regulatory actions might qualify for individual waivers? A: Emergencies addressing critical health, safety, or financial matters, or for some other compelling reason, may qualify for a waiver from some or all of the requirements of Section 2. Please submit requests for a waiver assessment to your OIRA Desk Officer prior to submitting the rule for OMB review under EO 12866. Note that Section 2(b) of EO applies “unless otherwise required by law.” Agencies may proceed with significant regulatory actions that need to be finalized in order to comply with an imminent statutory or judicial deadline even if they are not able to identify offsetting regulatory actions by the time of issuance. In the unlikely case where your agency believes other regulatory actions, which are not needed to comply with an imminent statutory or judicial deadline, are required by law, please consult with your OIRA Desk Officer. In all cases, however, agencies should identify additional regulatory actions to be repealed in order to offset the cost of the new significant regulatory action, even if such action is required by law. Q: Can regulatory and deregulatory actions be bundled in the same regulatory action? A: Yes, under certain circumstances. In practice, many regulatory actions can both impose new requirements and remove or streamline existing requirements on the same regulated entities and within the same regulatory program. In this case, the agency must clearly identify the specific provisions that are counted within the regulatory and deregulatory portion of the rules, and the costs and cost savings associated with each. The net cost impact (the different between costs imposed and cost savings) of such rules will generally determine whether they are regulatory actions that need to be offset. Agencies, however, should avoid artificially bundling provisions that are not logically connected in a single regulatory action. Q: What must agencies do to “identify” existing regulatory actions to be repealed? A: At a minimum, the agency should identify all of the associated regulatory actions to be repealed, along with cost saving estimates, no later than the date of issuance of the corresponding new significant regulatory action. Agencies should confirm that they will continue to achieve their regulatory objectives (such as health or environmental protection). All of the regulatory actions slated for repeal but not yet finalized also must be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda. Q: Do deregulatory actions have to be finalized before new regulatory actions can be finalized? A: Per Section 2(a), each agency must identify two existing regulatory actions to be repealed. For many significant regulatory actions, the most appropriate place for such an identification is in the preamble of the rule being issued for notice and comment or promulgated. To the extent feasible, regulatory actions should be eliminated before or on the same schedule as the new regulatory action they offset. In cases where finalizing an offsetting regulation is not possible, agencies should provide a plan for finalizing the offsetting regulation. The most appropriate place for such a plan is the preamble of the rule being issued. The plan should include a commitment to include the offsetting regulation in the next addition of the Unified Regulatory Agenda, with dates for any required regulatory actions and estimates of the associated cost savings. Q: How does this EO interact with other EOs and guidance addressing regulatory activities? A: All requirements under other EOs and implementing guidance (e.g., EO 12866 and OMB Circular A-4) remain applicable. Q: Can savings be transferred within an agency? A: Yes. The requirements of this EO apply agency-wide. Regulatory savings by a component in one agency can be used to offset a regulatory burden by a different component in that same agency. Q: Can savings be transferred from other agencies? A: Agencies that are not able to generate sufficient savings to account for new regulatory actions they must issue may submit a written request to the Director of OMB to transfer savings from another agency before they submit a regulatory action for review that does not contain the needed offset. However, if the Director does not concur with this request, the Agency must identify adequate offsets absent a waiver. Q: How does the regulatory cost cap in Section 2 of the EO affect the consideration of regulatory benefits or other requirements under EO 12866? A: The regulatory cost cap has no effect on the requirements of EO 12866 or the consideration of regulatory benefits in making regulatory decisions. The goal of the requirement to eliminate two existing regulatory actions for each new significant regulatory action is to provide a mechanism for agencies to identify and repeal outdated, ineffective, or unnecessary regulatory actions. Similar to fiscal spending caps, the goal of the regulatory cost cap is to provide a mechanism for the prudent management and control of regulatory costs imposed on society by agencies attempting to achieve regulatory benefits.

Learn more about our founding document. ""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."" — Preamble to the Constitution The Constitution of the United States of America is the supreme law of the United States. Empowered with the sovereign authority of the people by the framers and the consent of the legislatures of the states, it is the source of all government powers, and also provides important limitations on the government that protect the fundamental rights of United States citizens. Read the full text of the Constitution Why a Constitution? | The Constitutional Convention Ratification | The Bill of Rights   Why a Constitution? The need for the Constitution grew out of problems with the Articles of Confederation, which established a ""firm league of friendship"" between the states, and vested most power in a Congress of the Confederation. This power was, however, extremely limited — the central government conducted diplomacy and made war, set weights and measures, and was the final arbiter of disputes between the states. Crucially, it could not raise any funds itself, and was entirely dependent on the states themselves for the money necessary to operate. Each state sent a delegation of between two and seven members to the Congress, and they voted as a bloc with each state getting one vote. But any decision of consequence required a unanimous vote, which led to a government that was paralyzed and ineffectual. A movement to reform the Articles began, and invitations to attend a convention in Philadelphia to discuss changes to the Articles were sent to the state legislatures in 1787. In May of that year, delegates from 12 of the 13 states (Rhode Island sent no representatives) convened in Philadelphia to begin the work of redesigning government. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention quickly began work on drafting a new Constitution for the United States. The Constitutional Convention A chief aim of the Constitution as drafted by the Convention was to create a government with enough power to act on a national level, but without so much power that fundamental rights would be at risk. One way that this was accomplished was to separate the power of government into three branches, and then to include checks and balances on those powers to assure that no one branch of government gained supremacy. This concern arose largely out of the experience that the delegates had with the King of England and his powerful Parliament. The powers of each branch are enumerated in the Constitution, with powers not assigned to them reserved to the states. Much of the debate, which was conducted in secret to ensure that delegates spoke their minds, focused on the form that the new legislature would take. Two plans competed to become the new government: the Virginia Plan, which apportioned representation based on the population of each state, and the New Jersey plan, which gave each state an equal vote in Congress. The Virginia Plan was supported by the larger states, and the New Jersey plan preferred by the smaller. In the end, they settled on the Great Compromise (sometimes called the Connecticut Compromise), in which the House of Representatives would represent the people as apportioned by population; the Senate would represent the states apportioned equally; and the President would be elected by the Electoral College. The plan also called for an independent judiciary. The founders also took pains to establish the relationship between the states. States are required to give ""full faith and credit"" to the laws, records, contracts, and judicial proceedings of the other states, although Congress may regulate the manner in which the states share records, and define the scope of this clause. States are barred from discriminating against citizens of other states in any way, and cannot enact tariffs against one another. States must also extradite those accused of crimes to other states for trial. The founders also specified a process by which the Constitution may be amended, and since its ratification, the Constitution has been amended 27 times. In order to prevent arbitrary changes, the process for making amendments is quite onerous. An amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress, or, if two-thirds of the states request one, by a convention called for that purpose. The amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each state for ratification. In modern times, amendments have traditionally specified a timeframe in which this must be accomplished, usually a period of several years. Additionally, the Constitution specifies that no amendment can deny a state equal representation in the Senate without that state's consent. With the details and language of the Constitution decided, the Convention got down to the work of actually setting the Constitution to paper. It is written in the hand of a delegate from Pennsylvania, Gouverneur Morris, whose job allowed him some reign over the actual punctuation of a few clauses in the Constitution. He is also credited with the famous preamble, quoted at the top of this page. On September 17, 1787, 39 of the 55 delegates signed the new document, with many of those who refused to sign objecting to the lack of a bill of rights. At least one delegate refused to sign because the Constitution codified and protected slavery and the slave trade. Ratification The process set out in the Constitution for its ratification provided for much popular debate in the states. The Constitution would take effect once it had been ratified by nine of the thirteen state legislatures -- unanimity was not required. During the debate over the Constitution, two factions emerged: the Federalists, who supported adoption, and the Anti-Federalists, who opposed it. James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay set out an eloquent defense of the new Constitution in what came to be called the Federalist Papers. Published anonymously in the newspapers The Independent Journal and The New York Packet under the name Publius between October 1787 and August 1788, the 85 articles that comprise the Federalist Papers remain to this day an invaluable resource for understanding some of the framers' intentions for the Constitution. The most famous of the articles are No. 10, which warns of the dangers of factions and advocates a large republic, and No. 51, which explains the structure of the Constitution, its checks and balances, and how it protects the rights of the people. The states proceeded to begin ratification, with some debating more intensely than others. Delaware was the first state to ratify, on December 7, 1787. After New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify, on June 22, 1788, the Confederation Congress established March 9, 1789, as the date to begin operating under the Constitution. By this time, all the states except North Carolina and Rhode Island had ratified — the Ocean State was the last to ratify on May 29, 1790. The Bill of Rights One of the principal points of contention between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists was the lack of an enumeration of basic civil rights in the Constitution. Many Federalists argued, as in Federalist No. 84, that the people surrendered no rights in adopting the Constitution. In several states, however, the ratification debate in some states hinged on the adoption of a bill of rights. The solution was known as the Massachusetts Compromise, in which four states ratified the Constitution but at the same time sent recommendations for amendments to the Congress. James Madison introduced 12 amendments to the First Congress in 1789. Ten of these would go on to become what we now consider to be the Bill of Rights. One was never passed, while another dealing with Congressional salaries was not ratified until 1992, when it became the 27th Amendment. Based on the Virginia Declaration of Rights, the English Bill of Rights, the writings of the Enlightenment, and the rights defined in the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights contains rights that many today consider to be fundamental to America. The First Amendment provides that Congress make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise. It protects freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and the right to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. The Second Amendment gives citizens the right to bear arms. The Third Amendment prohibits the government from quartering troops in private homes, a major grievance during the American Revolution. The Fourth Amendment protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure. The government may not conduct any searches without a warrant, and such warrants must be issued by a judge and based on probable cause. The Fifth Amendment provides that citizens not be subject to criminal prosecution and punishment without due process. Citizens may not be tried on the same set of facts twice, and are protected from self-incrimination (the right to remain silent). The amendment also establishes the power of eminent domain, ensuring that private property is not seized for public use without just compensation. The Sixth Amendment assures the right to a speedy trial by a jury of one's peers, to be informed of the crimes with which they are charged, and to confront the witnesses brought by the government. The amendment also provides the accused the right to compel testimony from witnesses, and to legal representation. The Seventh Amendment provides that civil cases also be tried by jury. The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail, excessive fines, and cruel and unusual punishments. The Ninth Amendment states that the list of rights enumerated in the Constitution is not exhaustive, and that the people retain all rights not enumerated. The Tenth Amendment assigns all powers not delegated to the United States, or prohibited to the states, to either the states or to the people.   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

The U.S. lost nearly 300,000 manufacturing jobs during this period, while the share of Americans in the work force plummeted to lows not seen since the 1970s, the national debt doubled, and middle class got smaller. To get the economy back on track, President Trump has outlined a bold plan to create 25 million new American jobs in the next decade and return to 4 percent annual economic growth. The plan starts with pro-growth tax reform to help American workers and businesses keep more of their hard-earned dollars. The President’s plan will lower rates for Americans in every tax bracket, simplify the tax code, and reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate, which is one of the highest in the world. Fixing a tax code that is outdated, overly complex, and too onerous will unleash America’s economy, creating millions of new jobs and boosting economic growth. As a lifelong job-creator and businessman, the President also knows how important it is to get Washington out of the way of America’s small businesses, entrepreneurs, and workers. In 2015 alone, federal regulations cost the American economy more than $2 trillion. That is why the President has proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations and is ordering the heads of federal agencies and departments to identify job-killing regulations that should be repealed. With decades of deal-making experience, the President also understands how critical it is to negotiate the best possible trade deals for the United States. By renegotiating existing trade deals, and taking a tough stance on future ones, we will ensure that trade agreements bring good-paying jobs to our shores and support American manufacturing, the backbone of our economy. The President plans to show America’s trading partners that we mean business by ensuring consequences for countries that engage in illegal or unfair trade practices that hurt American workers. By standing side-by-side with America’s workers and businesses, the President’s policies will unleash economic growth, create 25 million new jobs, and help Make America Great Again.

""I am naturally the most unambitious of women and life in the White House has no attractions for me."" Mrs. Wilson was writing to thank President Taft for advice concerning the mansion he was leaving. Two years as first lady of New Jersey had given her valuable experience in the duties of a woman whose time belongs to the people. She always played a public role with dignity and grace but never learned to enjoy it. Those who knew her in the White House described her as calm and sweet, a motherly woman, pretty and refined. Her soft Southern voice had kept its slow drawl through many changes of residence. Ellen Louise Axson grew up in Rome, Georgia, where her father, the Reverend S.E. Axson, was a Presbyterian minister. Thomas Woodrow Wilson first saw her when he was about six and she only a baby. In 1883, as a young lawyer from Atlanta, ""Tommy"" visited Rome and met ""Miss Ellie Lou"" again -- a beautiful girl now, keeping house for a bereaved father. He thought, ""what splendid laughing eyes!"" Despite their instant attraction they did not marry until 1885, because she was unwilling to leave her heartbroken father. That same year Bryn Mawr College offered Wilson a teaching position at an annual salary of $1,500. He and his bride lived near the campus, keeping her little brother with them. Humorously insisting that her own children must not be born Yankees, she went to relatives in Georgia for the birth of Margaret in 1886 and Jessie in 1887. But Eleanor was born in Connecticut, while Wilson was teaching at Wesleyan University. His distinguished career at Princeton began in 1890, bringing his wife new social responsibilities. From such demands she took refuge, as always, in art. She had studied briefly in New York, and the quality of her paintings compares favorably with professional art of the period. She had a studio with a skylight installed at the White House in 1913, and found time for painting despite the weddings of two daughters within six months and the duties of hostess for the nation. The Wilsons had preferred to begin the administration without an inaugural ball, and the First Lady's entertainments were simple; but her unaffected cordiality made her parties successful. In their first year she convinced her scrupulous husband that it would be perfectly proper to invite influential legislators to a private dinner, and when such an evening led to agreement on a tariff bill, he told a friend, ""You see what a wise wife I have!"" Descendant of slave owners, Ellen Wilson lent her prestige to the cause of improving housing in the capital's Negro slums. Visiting dilapidated alleys, she brought them to the attention of debutantes and Congressmen. Her death spurred passage of a remedial bill she had worked for. Her health failing slowly from Bright's disease, she died serenely on August 6, 1914. On the day before her death, she made her physician promise to tell Wilson ""later"" that she hoped he would marry again; she murmured at the end, ""...take good care of my husband."" Struggling grimly to control his grief, Wilson took her to Rome for burial among her kin.

Trump signed House Joint Resolution 38 to stop the costly Stream Protection Rule from further harming coal workers and the communities that depend on them. H.J.Res. 38 blocks an overly burdensome regulation that threatened the coal industry with millions of dollars in compliance costs, reduced coal production, and fewer jobs. Since 2009, the coal industry has declined, leaving workers and communities without a lifeline. Over 36,000 jobs have been lost without any relief in sight. From 2009 to 2015, American coal production has declined by over 177,000,000 tons, and over 600 coal mines have closed. H.J.Res. 38 will give coal country relief from these harmful regulations created under the Obama Administration. During the campaign, President Trump promised coal workers he would support them and reverse the harmful actions of the past administration. Since taking office, President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on all Americans, their pocketbooks, and their businesses. President Trump has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated.

Camp David, known formally as the Naval Support Facility Thurmont, is the President’s country residence. Located in Catoctin Mountain Park in Frederick County, Maryland, Camp David has offered Presidents an opportunity for solitude and tranquility, as well as an ideal place to host foreign leaders. Adapted from the federal employee retreat Hi-Catoctin, President Franklin Roosevelt established the residence as USS Shangri La, modeling the new main lodge after the Roosevelt winter vacation home in Warm Springs, Georgia. President Eisenhower subsequently renamed the institution in honor of his grandson David. Camp David has been used extensively to host foreign dignitaries. Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Great Britain attended the first such meeting in May of 1943; the summit held at the residence in 1978 for Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin resulted in what are now known as the Camp David Accords.   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

Because the education of our young people is so important, the parents of every student in America should have a right to a meaningful choice about where their child goes to school. By expanding school choice and providing more educational opportunities for every American family, we can help make sure that every child has an equal shot at achieving the American Dream.  More choices for our students will make our schools better for everybody. Our country is home to many great schools and many extraordinary teachers -- whether they serve in traditional public schools, public charter schools, magnet schools, private or religious schools, or in homeschooling environments. With a renewed commitment to expanding school choice for our children, we can truly make a great education possible for every child in America. I commend our Nation's students, parents, teachers, and school leaders for their commitment to quality, effective education, and I call on States and communities to support effective education and school choice for every child in America. As our country celebrates National School Choice Week, I encourage parents to evaluate the educational opportunities available for their children.  I also encourage State lawmakers and Federal lawmakers to expand school choice for millions of additional students. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 22 through January 28, 2017, as National School Choice Week. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

She was also the mother of the sixth President, John Quincy Adams. A political influencer, she is remembered for the many letters of advice she exchanged with her husband during the Continental Congresses.  Inheriting New England's strongest traditions, Abigail Smith was born in 1744 at Weymouth, Massachusetts. On her mother's side she was descended from the Quincys, a family of great prestige in the colony; her father and other forebearers were Congregational ministers, leaders in a society that held its clergy in high esteem. Like other women of the time, Abigail lacked formal education; but her curiosity spurred her keen intelligence, and she read avidly the books at hand. Reading created a bond between her and young John Adams, Harvard graduate launched on a career in law, and they were married in 1764. It was a marriage of the mind and of the heart, enduring for more than half a century, enriched by time. The young couple lived on John's small farm at Braintree or in Boston as his practice expanded. In ten years she bore three sons and two daughters; she looked after family and home when he went traveling as circuit judge. ""Alas!"" she wrote in December 1773, ""How many snow banks divide thee and me...."" Long separations kept Abigail from her husband while he served the country they loved, as delegate to the Continental Congress, envoy abroad, elected officer under the Constitution. Her letters--pungent, witty, and vivid, spelled just as she spoke--detail her life in times of revolution. They tell the story of the woman who stayed at home to struggle with wartime shortages and inflation; to run the farm with a minimum of help; to teach four children when formal education was interrupted. Most of all, they tell of her loneliness without her ""dearest Friend."" The ""one single expression,"" she said, ""dwelt upon my mind and played about my Heart...."" In 1784, she joined him at his diplomatic post in Paris, and observed with interest the manners of the French. After 1785, she filled the difficult role of wife of the first United States Minister to Great Britain, and did so with dignity and tact. They returned happily in 1788 to Massachusetts and the handsome house they had just acquired in Braintree, later called Quincy, home for the rest of their lives. As wife of the first Vice President, Abigail became a good friend to Mrs. Washington and a valued help in official entertaining, drawing on her experience of courts and society abroad. After 1791, however, poor health forced her to spend as much time as possible in Quincy. Illness or trouble found her resolute; as she once declared, she would ""not forget the blessings which sweeten life."" When John Adams was elected President, she continued a formal pattern of entertaining--even in the primitive conditions she found at the new capital in November 1800. The city was wilderness, the President's House far from completion. Her private complaints to her family provide blunt accounts of both, but for her three months in Washington she duly held her dinners and receptions. The Adamses retired to Quincy in 1801, and for 17 years enjoyed the companionship that public life had long denied them. Abigail died in 1818, and is buried beside her husband in United First Parish Church. She leaves her country a most remarkable record as patriot and First Lady, wife of one President and mother of another.

During her time as a First Lady (1850-1853), she made certain the White House had a music room and three pianos, and she further made additions to the White House library. First of First Ladies to hold a job after marriage, Abigail Fillmore was helping her husband's career. She was also revealing her most striking personal characteristic: eagerness to learn and pleasure in teaching others. She was born in Saratoga County, New York, in 1798, while it was still on the fringe of civilization. Her father, a locally prominent Baptist preacher named Lemuel Powers, died shortly thereafter. Courageously, her mother moved on westward, thinking her scanty funds would go further in a less settled region, and ably educated her small son and daughter beyond the usual frontier level with the help of her husband's library. Shared eagerness for schooling formed a bond when Abigail Powers at 21 met Millard Fillmore at 19, both students at a recently opened academy in the village of New Hope. Although she soon became young Fillmore's inspiration, his struggle to make his way as a lawyer was so long and ill paid that they were not married until February 1826. She even resumed teaching school after the marriage. And then her only son, Millard Powers, was born in 1828. Attaining prosperity at last, Fillmore bought his family a six-room house in Buffalo, where little Mary Abigail was born in 1832. Enjoying comparative luxury, Abigail learned the ways of society as the wife of a Congressman. She cultivated a noted flower garden; but much of her time, as always, she spent reading. In 1847, Fillmore was elected state comptroller; with the children away in boarding school and college, the parents moved temporarily to Albany. In 1849, Abigail Fillmore came to Washington as wife of the Vice President; 16 months later, after Zachary Taylor's death at a height of sectional crisis, the Fillmores moved into the White House. Even after the period of official mourning the social life of the Fillmore administration remained subdued. The First Lady presided with grace at state dinners and receptions; but a permanently injured ankle made her Friday-evening levees an ordeal--two hours of standing at her husband's side to greet the public. In any case, she preferred reading or music in private. Pleading her delicate health, she entrusted many routine social duties to her attractive daughter, ""Abby."" With a special appropriation from Congress, she spent contented hours selecting books for a White House library and arranging them in the oval room upstairs, where Abby had her piano, harp, and guitar. Here, wrote a friend, Mrs. Fillmore ""could enjoy the music she so much loved, and the conversation of...cultivated society...."" Despite chronic poor health, Mrs. Fillmore stayed near her husband through the outdoor ceremonies of President Pierce's inauguration while a raw northeast wind whipped snow over the crowd. Returning chilled to the Willard Hotel, she developed pneumonia; she died there on March 30, 1853. The House of Representatives and the Senate adjourned, and public offices closed in respect, as her family took her body home to Buffalo for burial.

EST THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you all for coming.  We had a couple of great meetings this morning -- the airline industry, we're going to get that one going.  They've got a lot of problems but it's going to be good.  We just had talks with Qatar and a couple of countries -- Afghanistan.  I would say that that's a tough situation but we'll do something about it.  We'll be having some -- we'll be giving you some pretty -- information -- pretty good information soon.  We're going to have some good, big conversations with other world leaders over the next few hours.  A lot of things happening, a lot of positive things. I want to start by thanking Senator Manchin for having the courage to vote for somebody that's really very outstanding, really outstanding -- as good as they've seen in a long time.  Nominating the justice to the Supreme Court, a justice, has always been considered one of the very important things that a President can do.   I guess I'm looking very much at defense and we're negotiating a lot of contracts with airlines and a lot of other people, but when you get right down to it, the F-35 Fighter is very important and all of the things we're doing are very important.  But I've always considered, and I guess a lot of people have, the Supreme Court nominees to be right up there -- right up there.  We'll take defense, number one, I think, Senator, we have to go with defense of our country, number one.  And right after that, I suspect it's going to be Supreme Court justices.   And Judge Gorsuch is an exceptionally qualified nominee -- probably there's rarely been anybody that's been more qualified.  He has impeccable academic and legal credentials.  He went to Columbia -- very, very great student.  He went to Harvard, top of his class.  He went to Oxford, great student, great intellect.  He has an outstanding record for 10 years on the bench.  One of the great writers they say -- legal writers -- I've read some of the things that he's written and, believe me, he is a great, great writer.  He'll respect and very much respect the Constitution, as written, and he will apply the law as written.   He's a mainstream judge, very much mainstream, and I urge you all to confirm him.  He's been doing very well.  A lot of people are liking him very much on the other side.  And I think that, because of politics, perhaps they're not going to vote for him.  I think that's a shame because that's not being honest.   I've had a couple of people tell me from the other side -- because, believe it or not, I have a lot of friends on the other side too -- and they think he's outstanding.  And then they go on to tell me that perhaps they won't be able to do that.  But that's one of the reasons that our country is in stagnation in so many different forms and so many different ways.  I think it's very dishonest and I think it's very unfortunate.   But we'll see what happens.  I think he's doing very well.  And I know that some people are going to come on board and hopefully we can do this in a very quick and civil manner. The Cabinet slowly is happening.  Jeff Sessions just got -- you're very happy about that -- because Jeff is outstanding.  And we just swore in Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, and I think he's going to be outstanding. So I just want to thank you all for being here.  We're going to have a good lunch and we're going to talk about our Supreme Court nominee, somebody who will do a fantastic job for many years to come.  Thank you very much. Q    Mr. President, any comment on Judge Gorsuch's comments about you, sir? THE PRESIDENT:  You misrepresented his comments. Q    I just wanted to ask you what your thoughts were, sir. THE PRESIDENT:  His comments were misrepresented.  And what you should do is ask Senator Blumenthal about his Vietnam record that didn't exist after years of saying it did.  So ask Senator Blumenthal about his Vietnam record.  He misrepresented that just like he misrepresented Judge Gorsuch. Thank you all very much. END 12:45 P.M.

She was the youngest First Lady to pass away and one of only three to have passed away in the White House.  Letitia Tyler had been confined to an invalid's chair for two years when her husband unexpectedly became President. Nobody had thought of that possibility when he took his oath of office as Vice President on March 4, 1841; indeed, he had planned to fill his undemanding duties from his home in Williamsburg where his wife was most comfortable, her Bible, prayer book, and knitting at her side. Born on a Tidewater Virginia plantation in the 18th century, Letitia was spiritually akin to Martha Washington and Martha Jefferson. Formal education was no part of this pattern of life, but Letitia learned all the skills of managing a plantation, rearing a family, and presiding over a home that would be John Tyler's refuge during an active political life. They were married on March 29, 1813--his twenty-third birthday. Thereafter, whether he served in Congress or as Governor of Virginia, she attended to domestic duties. Only once did she join him for the winter social season in Washington. Of the eight children she bore, seven survived; but after 1839 she was a cripple, though ""still beautiful now in her declining years."" So her admiring new daughter-in-law, Priscilla Cooper Tyler, described her--""the most entirely unselfish person you can imagine...Notwithstanding her very delicate health, mother attends to and regulates all the household affairs and all so quietly that you can't tell when she does it."" In a second-floor room at the White House, Letitia Tyler kept her quiet but pivotal role in family activities. She did not attempt to take part in the social affairs of the administration. Her married daughters had their own homes; the others were too young for the full responsibility of official entertaining; Priscilla at age 24 assumed the position of White House hostess, met its demands with spirit and success, and enjoyed it. Daughter of a well-known tragedian, Priscilla Cooper had gone on the stage herself at 17. Playing Desdemona to her father's Othello in Richmond, she won the instant interest of Robert Tyler, whom she married in 1839. Intelligent and beautiful, with dark brown hair, she charmed the President's guests--from visiting celebrities like Charles Dickens to enthusiastic countrymen. Once she noted ruefully: ""such hearty shakes as they gave my poor little hand too!"" She enjoyed the expert advice of Dolley Madison, and the companionship of her young sister-in-law Elizabeth until she married William N. Waller in 1842. For this wedding Letitia made her only appearance at a White House social function. ""Lizzie looked surpassingly lovely,"" said Priscilla, and ""our dear mother"" was ""far more attractive to me...than any other lady in the room,"" greeting her guests ""in her sweet, gentle, self-possessed manner."" The first President's wife to die in the White House, Letitia Tyler ended her days peacefully on September 10, 1842, holding a damask rose in her hand. She was taken to Virginia for burial at the plantation of her birth, deeply mourned by her family. ""She had everything about her,"" said Priscilla, ""to awaken love...""

She served as First Lady of the United States from 1853 to 1857. In looks and in pathetic destiny young Jane Means Appleton resembled the heroine of a Victorian novel. The gentle dignity of her face reflected her sensitive, retiring personality and physical weakness. Her father had died--he was a Congregational minister, the Reverend Jesse Appleton, president of Bowdoin College--and her mother had taken the family to Amherst, New Hampshire. And Jane met a Bowdoin graduate, a young lawyer with political ambitions, Franklin Pierce. Although he was immediately devoted to Jane, they did not marry until she was 28 -- surprising in that day of early marriages. Her family opposed the match; moreover, she always did her best to discourage his interest in politics. The death of a three-day-old son, the arrival of a new baby, and Jane's dislike of Washington counted heavily in his decision to retire at the apparent height of his career, as United States Senator, in 1842. Little Frank Robert, the second son, died the next year of typhus. Service in the Mexican War brought Pierce the rank of brigadier and local fame as a hero. He returned home safely, and for four years the Pierces lived quietly at Concord, New Hampshire, in the happiest period of their lives. With attentive pleasure Jane watched her son Benjamin growing up. Then, in 1852, the Democratic Party made Pierce their candidate for President. His wife fainted at the news. When he took her to Newport for a respite, Benny wrote to her: ""I hope he won't be elected for I should not like to be at Washington and I know you would not either."" But the President-elect convinced Jane that his office would be an asset for Benny's success in life. On a journey by train, January 6, 1853, their car was derailed and Benny killed before their eyes. The whole nation shared the parents' grief. The inauguration on March 4 took place without an inaugural ball and without the presence of Mrs. Pierce. She joined her husband later that month, but any pleasure the White House might have brought her was gone. From this loss she never recovered fully. Other events deepened the somber mood of the new administration: Mrs. Fillmore's death in March, that of Vice President Rufus King in April. Always devout, Jane Pierce turned for solace to prayer. She had to force herself to meet the social obligations inherent in the role of First Lady. Fortunately she had the companionship and help of a girlhood friend, now her aunt by marriage, Abigail Kent Means. Mrs. Robert E. Lee wrote in a private letter: ""I have known many of the ladies of the White House, none more truly excellent than the afflicted wife of President Pierce. Her health was a bar to any great effort on her part to meet the expectations of the public in her high position but she was a refined, extremely religious and well educated lady."" With retirement, the Pierces made a prolonged trip abroad in search of health for the invalid--she carried Benny's Bible throughout the journey. The quest was unsuccessful, so the couple came home to New Hampshire to be near family and friends until Jane's death in 1863. She was buried near Benny's grave.

At the 1896 Republican Convention, in time of depression, the wealthy Cleveland businessman Marcus Alonzo Hanna ensured the nomination of his friend William McKinley as ""the advance agent of prosperity."" The Democrats, advocating the ""free and unlimited coinage of both silver and gold""--which would have mildly inflated the currency--nominated William Jennings Bryan. While Hanna used large contributions from eastern Republicans frightened by Bryan's views on silver, McKinley met delegations on his front porch in Canton, Ohio. He won by the largest majority of popular votes since 1872. Born in Niles, Ohio, in 1843, McKinley briefly attended Allegheny College, and was teaching in a country school when the Civil War broke out. Enlisting as a private in the Union Army, he was mustered out at the end of the war as a brevet major of volunteers. He studied law, opened an office in Canton, Ohio, and married Ida Saxton, daughter of a local banker. At 34, McKinley won a seat in Congress. His attractive personality, exemplary character, and quick intelligence enabled him to rise rapidly. He was appointed to the powerful Ways and Means Committee. Robert M. La Follette, Sr., who served with him, recalled that he generally ""represented the newer view,"" and ""on the great new questions .. was generally on the side of the public and against private interests."" During his 14 years in the House, he became the leading Republican tariff expert, giving his name to the measure enacted in 1890. The next year he was elected Governor of Ohio, serving two terms. When McKinley became President, the depression of 1893 had almost run its course and with it the extreme agitation over silver. Deferring action on the money question, he called Congress into special session to enact the highest tariff in history. In the friendly atmosphere of the McKinley Administration, industrial combinations developed at an unprecedented pace. Newspapers caricatured McKinley as a little boy led around by ""Nursie"" Hanna, the representative of the trusts. However, McKinley was not dominated by Hanna; he condemned the trusts as ""dangerous conspiracies against the public good."" Not prosperity, but foreign policy, dominated McKinley's Administration. Reporting the stalemate between Spanish forces and revolutionaries in Cuba, newspapers screamed that a quarter of the population was dead and the rest suffering acutely. Public indignation brought pressure upon the President for war. Unable to restrain Congress or the American people, McKinley delivered his message of neutral intervention in April 1898. Congress thereupon voted three resolutions tantamount to a declaration of war for the liberation and independence of Cuba. In the 100-day war, the United States destroyed the Spanish fleet outside Santiago harbor in Cuba, seized Manila in the Philippines, and occupied Puerto Rico. ""Uncle Joe"" Cannon, later Speaker of the House, once said that McKinley kept his ear so close to the ground that it was full of grasshoppers. When McKinley was undecided what to do about Spanish possessions other than Cuba, he toured the country and detected an imperialist sentiment. Thus the United States annexed the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico. In 1900, McKinley again campaigned against Bryan. While Bryan inveighed against imperialism, McKinley quietly stood for ""the full dinner pail."" His second term, which had begun auspiciously, came to a tragic end in September 1901. He was standing in a receiving line at the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition when a deranged anarchist shot him twice. He died eight days later.

EST  THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  On behalf of President Donald Trump, it will be my great privilege today to administer the oath of office to America’s new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price.  (Applause.)  We're grateful to be joined by colleagues and friends to mark this important occasion in the life of our administration and no less extent in the life of this nation.  The American people can be proud of having the finest health care in the world.  But we all have known the challenges in recent years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.  President Trump has made it the top priority of this new Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with health care reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.  And finding someone to lead Health and Human Services who brings a background in medicine, a background in health care, a background in budgetary issues in the Congress of the United States, who understands the unique challenges of state officials in programs like Medicaid was easily met when he made the decision to name Dr. Tom Price as the new Secretary of Health and Human Services. Dr. Price is uniquely qualified to step into this leading role during this time of reform in the life of health care in America.  For nearly 20 years, Tom Price worked in private practice as an orthopedic surgeon in the Atlanta area, mending broken bones, giving people the hope and the health to lead lives to the fullest.  You passed on your wisdom by training rising generations of physicians at a local college and hospital -- an impressive career in health care. But your patients weren’t the only ones that benefitted by your leadership and by your example.  You would carry your leadership qualities into the Georgia State Senate where you served for eight years, becoming the majority leader of the Georgia State Senate, and helping to steer a time of real reform and renewal in the state of Georgia. Then it was on to Congress where I first met Dr. Price.  He would serve in the Congress now for more than 12 years -- chairman of the Budget Committee, but without question emerging as the most principled expert on health care policy in the House of Representatives, if not the entire Congress. And now President Trump has transformed you with leading the Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of the American people.  And as Secretary, we're both confident that you will bring that experience as a physician, that experience at the state level, and that singular experience at the national level to ensure that President Trump’s vision for a health care system in this country that works for every American will become a reality in the years ahead. So with that, on behalf of President Trump, is it my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office.   (The oath is administered.)  (Applause.)  END   11:31 A.M.

During their marriage, she relished travel to Japan, China, and diplomatic missions around the world.  As ""the only unusual incident"" of her girlhood, ""Nellie"" Herron Taft recalled her visit to the White House at 17 as the guest of President and Mrs. Hayes, intimate friends of her parents. Fourth child of Harriet Collins and John W. Herron, born in 1861, she had grown up in Cincinnati, Ohio, attending a private school in the city and studying music with enthusiasm. The year after this notable visit she met ""that adorable Will Taft,"" a tall young lawyer, at a sledding party. They found intellectual interests in common; friendship matured into love; Helen Herron and William Howard Taft were married in 1886. A ""treasure,"" he called her, ""self-contained, independent, and of unusual application."" He wondered if they would ever reach Washington ""in any official capacity"" and suggested to her that they might -- when she became Secretary of the Treasury! No woman could hope for such a career in that day, but Mrs. Taft welcomed each step in her husband's: state judge, Solicitor General of the United States, federal circuit judge. In 1900 he agreed to take charge of American civil government in the Philippines. By now the children numbered three: Robert, Helen, and Charles. The delight with which she undertook the journey, and her willingness to take her children to a country still unsettled by war, were characteristic of this woman who loved a challenge. In Manila she handled a difficult role with enthusiasm and tact; she relished travel to Japan and China, and a special diplomatic mission to the Vatican. Further travel with her husband, who became Secretary of War in 1904, brought a widened interest in world politics and a cosmopolitan circle of friends. His election to the Presidency in 1908 gave her a position she had long desired. As First Lady, she still took an interest in politics but concentrated on giving the administration a particular social brilliance. Only two months after the inauguration she suffered a severe stroke. An indomitable will had her back in command again within a year. At the New Year's reception for 1910, she appeared in white crepe embroidered with gold--a graceful figure. Her daughter left college for a year to take part in social life at the White House, and the gaiety of Helen's debut enhanced the 1910 Christmas season. During four years famous for social events, the most outstanding was an evening garden party for several thousand guests on the Tafts' silver wedding anniversary, June 19, 1911. Mrs. Taft remembered this as ""the greatest event"" in her White House experience. Her own book, Recollections of Full Years, gives her account of a varied life. And the capital's famous Japanese cherry trees, planted around the Tidal Basin at her request, form a notable memorial. Her public role in Washington did not end when she left the White House. In 1921 her husband was appointed Chief Justice of the United States--the position he had desired most of all--and she continued to live in the capital after his death in 1930. Retaining to the end her love of travel and of classical music, she died at her home on May 22, 1943.

Learn more about our founding document. ""We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."" — Preamble to the Constitution The Constitution of the United States of America is the supreme law of the United States. Empowered with the sovereign authority of the people by the framers and the consent of the legislatures of the states, it is the source of all government powers, and also provides important limitations on the government that protect the fundamental rights of United States citizens. Read the full text of the Constitution Why a Constitution? | The Constitutional Convention Ratification | The Bill of Rights   Why a Constitution? The need for the Constitution grew out of problems with the Articles of Confederation, which established a ""firm league of friendship"" between the states, and vested most power in a Congress of the Confederation. This power was, however, extremely limited — the central government conducted diplomacy and made war, set weights and measures, and was the final arbiter of disputes between the states. Crucially, it could not raise any funds itself, and was entirely dependent on the states themselves for the money necessary to operate. Each state sent a delegation of between two and seven members to the Congress, and they voted as a bloc with each state getting one vote. But any decision of consequence required a unanimous vote, which led to a government that was paralyzed and ineffectual. A movement to reform the Articles began, and invitations to attend a convention in Philadelphia to discuss changes to the Articles were sent to the state legislatures in 1787. In May of that year, delegates from 12 of the 13 states (Rhode Island sent no representatives) convened in Philadelphia to begin the work of redesigning government. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention quickly began work on drafting a new Constitution for the United States. The Constitutional Convention A chief aim of the Constitution as drafted by the Convention was to create a government with enough power to act on a national level, but without so much power that fundamental rights would be at risk. One way that this was accomplished was to separate the power of government into three branches, and then to include checks and balances on those powers to assure that no one branch of government gained supremacy. This concern arose largely out of the experience that the delegates had with the King of England and his powerful Parliament. The powers of each branch are enumerated in the Constitution, with powers not assigned to them reserved to the states. Much of the debate, which was conducted in secret to ensure that delegates spoke their minds, focused on the form that the new legislature would take. Two plans competed to become the new government: the Virginia Plan, which apportioned representation based on the population of each state, and the New Jersey plan, which gave each state an equal vote in Congress. The Virginia Plan was supported by the larger states, and the New Jersey plan preferred by the smaller. In the end, they settled on the Great Compromise (sometimes called the Connecticut Compromise), in which the House of Representatives would represent the people as apportioned by population; the Senate would represent the states apportioned equally; and the President would be elected by the Electoral College. The plan also called for an independent judiciary. The founders also took pains to establish the relationship between the states. States are required to give ""full faith and credit"" to the laws, records, contracts, and judicial proceedings of the other states, although Congress may regulate the manner in which the states share records, and define the scope of this clause. States are barred from discriminating against citizens of other states in any way, and cannot enact tariffs against one another. States must also extradite those accused of crimes to other states for trial. The founders also specified a process by which the Constitution may be amended, and since its ratification, the Constitution has been amended 27 times. In order to prevent arbitrary changes, the process for making amendments is quite onerous. An amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress, or, if two-thirds of the states request one, by a convention called for that purpose. The amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each state for ratification. In modern times, amendments have traditionally specified a timeframe in which this must be accomplished, usually a period of several years. Additionally, the Constitution specifies that no amendment can deny a state equal representation in the Senate without that state's consent. With the details and language of the Constitution decided, the Convention got down to the work of actually setting the Constitution to paper. It is written in the hand of a delegate from Pennsylvania, Gouverneur Morris, whose job allowed him some reign over the actual punctuation of a few clauses in the Constitution. He is also credited with the famous preamble, quoted at the top of this page. On September 17, 1787, 39 of the 55 delegates signed the new document, with many of those who refused to sign objecting to the lack of a bill of rights. At least one delegate refused to sign because the Constitution codified and protected slavery and the slave trade. Ratification The process set out in the Constitution for its ratification provided for much popular debate in the states. The Constitution would take effect once it had been ratified by nine of the thirteen state legislatures -- unanimity was not required. During the debate over the Constitution, two factions emerged: the Federalists, who supported adoption, and the Anti-Federalists, who opposed it. James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay set out an eloquent defense of the new Constitution in what came to be called the Federalist Papers. Published anonymously in the newspapers The Independent Journal and The New York Packet under the name Publius between October 1787 and August 1788, the 85 articles that comprise the Federalist Papers remain to this day an invaluable resource for understanding some of the framers' intentions for the Constitution. The most famous of the articles are No. 10, which warns of the dangers of factions and advocates a large republic, and No. 51, which explains the structure of the Constitution, its checks and balances, and how it protects the rights of the people. The states proceeded to begin ratification, with some debating more intensely than others. Delaware was the first state to ratify, on December 7, 1787. After New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify, on June 22, 1788, the Confederation Congress established March 9, 1789, as the date to begin operating under the Constitution. By this time, all the states except North Carolina and Rhode Island had ratified — the Ocean State was the last to ratify on May 29, 1790. The Bill of Rights One of the principal points of contention between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists was the lack of an enumeration of basic civil rights in the Constitution. Many Federalists argued, as in Federalist No. 84, that the people surrendered no rights in adopting the Constitution. In several states, however, the ratification debate in some states hinged on the adoption of a bill of rights. The solution was known as the Massachusetts Compromise, in which four states ratified the Constitution but at the same time sent recommendations for amendments to the Congress. James Madison introduced 12 amendments to the First Congress in 1789. Ten of these would go on to become what we now consider to be the Bill of Rights. One was never passed, while another dealing with Congressional salaries was not ratified until 1992, when it became the 27th Amendment. Based on the Virginia Declaration of Rights, the English Bill of Rights, the writings of the Enlightenment, and the rights defined in the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights contains rights that many today consider to be fundamental to America. The First Amendment provides that Congress make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise. It protects freedom of speech, the press, assembly, and the right to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. The Second Amendment gives citizens the right to bear arms. The Third Amendment prohibits the government from quartering troops in private homes, a major grievance during the American Revolution. The Fourth Amendment protects citizens from unreasonable search and seizure. The government may not conduct any searches without a warrant, and such warrants must be issued by a judge and based on probable cause. The Fifth Amendment provides that citizens not be subject to criminal prosecution and punishment without due process. Citizens may not be tried on the same set of facts twice, and are protected from self-incrimination (the right to remain silent). The amendment also establishes the power of eminent domain, ensuring that private property is not seized for public use without just compensation. The Sixth Amendment assures the right to a speedy trial by a jury of one's peers, to be informed of the crimes with which they are charged, and to confront the witnesses brought by the government. The amendment also provides the accused the right to compel testimony from witnesses, and to legal representation. The Seventh Amendment provides that civil cases also be tried by jury. The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail, excessive fines, and cruel and unusual punishments. The Ninth Amendment states that the list of rights enumerated in the Constitution is not exhaustive, and that the people retain all rights not enumerated. The Tenth Amendment assigns all powers not delegated to the United States, or prohibited to the states, to either the states or to the people.   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

Unique among First Ladies, Harriet Lane acted as hostess for the only President who never married: James Buchanan, her favorite uncle and her guardian after she was orphaned at the age of eleven. And of all the ladies of the White House, few achieved such great success in deeply troubled times as this polished young woman in her twenties. In the rich farming country of Franklin County, Pennsylvania, her family had prospered as merchants. Her uncle supervised her sound education in private school, completed by two years at the Visitation Convent in Georgetown. By this time, ""Nunc"" was Secretary of State, and he introduced her to fashionable circles as he had promised, ""in the best manner."" In 1854 she joined him in London, where he was minister to the Court of St. James. Queen Victoria gave ""dear Miss Lane"" the rank of ambassador's wife; admiring suitors gave her the fame of a beauty. In appearance ""Hal"" Lane was of medium height, with masses of light hair almost golden. In manner she enlivened social gatherings with a captivating mixture of spontaneity and poise. After the sadness of the Pierce administration, the capital eagerly welcomed its new ""Democratic Queen"" in 1857. Harriet Lane filled the White House with gaiety and flowers, and guided its social life with enthusiasm and discretion, winning national popularity. As sectional tensions increased, she worked out seating arrangements for her weekly formal dinner parties with special care, to give dignitaries their proper precedence and still keep political foes apart. Her tact did not falter, but her task became impossible--as did her uncle's. Seven states had seceded by the time Buchanan retired from office and thankfully returned with his niece to his spacious country home, Wheatland, near Lancaster, Pennsylvania. From her teenage years, the popular Miss Lane flirted happily with numerous beaux, calling them ""pleasant but dreadfully troublesome."" Buchanan often warned her against ""rushing precipitately into matrimonial connexions,"" and she waited until she was almost 36 to marry. She chose, with her uncle's approval, Henry Elliott Johnston, a Baltimore banker. Within the next 18 years she faced one sorrow after another: the loss of her uncle, her two fine young sons, and her husband. Thereafter she decided to live in Washington, among friends made during years of happiness. She had acquired a sizable art collection, largely of European works, which she bequeathed to the government. Accepted after her death in 1903, it inspired an official of the Smithsonian Institution to call her ""First Lady of the National Collection of Fine Arts."" In addition, she had dedicated a generous sum to endow a home for invalid children at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. It became an outstanding pediatric facility, and its national reputation is a fitting memorial to the young lady who presided at the White House with such dignity and charm. The Harriet Lane Outpatient Clinics serve thousands of children today.

Due to ill health, she left, however, much of the official hostess duties to her daughter Betty Taylor.  After the election of 1848, a passenger on a Mississippi riverboat struck up a conversation with easy-mannered Gen. Zachary Taylor, not knowing his identity. The passenger remarked that he didn't think the general qualified for the Presidency--was the stranger ""a Taylor man""? ""Not much of one,"" came the reply. The general went on to say that he hadn't voted for Taylor, partly because his wife was opposed to sending ""Old Zack"" to Washington, ""where she would be obliged to go with him!"" It was a truthful answer. Moreover, the story goes that Margaret Taylor had taken a vow during the Mexican War: If her husband returned safely, she would never go into society again. In fact she never did, though prepared for it by genteel upbringing. ""Peggy"" Smith was born in Calvert County, Maryland, daughter of Ann Mackall and Walter Smith, a major in the Revolutionary War according to family tradition. In 1809, visiting a sister in Kentucky, she met young Lieutenant Taylor. They were married the following June, and for a while the young wife stayed on the farm given them as a wedding present by Zachary's father. She bore her first baby there, but cheerfully followed her husband from one remote garrison to another along the western frontier of civilization. An admiring civilian official cited her as one of the ""delicate females...reared in tenderness"" who had to educate ""worthy and most interesting"" children at a fort in Indian country. Two small girls died in 1820 of what Taylor called ""a violent bilious fever,"" which left their mother's health impaired; three girls and a boy grew up. Knowing the hardships of a military wife, Taylor opposed his daughters' marrying career soldiers--but each eventually married into the Army. The second daughter, Knox, married Lt. Jefferson Davis in gentle defiance of her parents. In a loving letter home, she imagined her mother skimming milk in the cellar or going out to feed the chickens. Within three months of her wedding, Knox died of malaria. Taylor was not reconciled to Davis until they fought together in Mexico; in Washington the second Mrs. Davis became a good friend of Mrs. Taylor's, often calling on her at the White House. Though Peggy Taylor welcomed friends and kinfolk in her upstairs sitting room, presided at the family table, met special groups at her husband's side, and worshiped regularly at St. John's Episcopal Church, she took no part in formal social functions. She relegated all the duties of official hostess to her youngest daughter, Mary Elizabeth, then 25 and recent bride of Lt. Col. William W.S. Bliss, adjutant and secretary to the President. Betty Bliss filled her role admirably. One observer thought that her manner blended ""the artlessness of a rustic belle and the grace of a duchess.""

Peace through strength will be at the center of that foreign policy. This principle will make possible a stable, more peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground. Defeating ISIS and other radical Islamic terror groups will be our highest priority. To defeat and destroy these groups, we will pursue aggressive joint and coalition military operations when necessary. In addition, the Trump Administration will work with international partners to cut off funding for terrorist groups, to expand intelligence sharing, and to engage in cyberwarfare to disrupt and disable propaganda and recruiting. Next, we will rebuild the American military. Our Navy has shrunk from more than 500 ships in 1991 to 275 in 2016. Our Air Force is roughly one third smaller than in 1991. President Trump is committed to reversing this trend, because he knows that our military dominance must be unquestioned. Finally, in pursuing a foreign policy based on American interests, we will embrace diplomacy. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends, and when old friends become allies. The world will be more peaceful and more prosperous with a stronger and more respected America.   Trade Deals Working For All Americans For too long, Americans have been forced to accept trade deals that put the interests of insiders and the Washington elite over the hard-working men and women of this country. As a result, blue-collar towns and cities have watched their factories close and good-paying jobs move overseas, while Americans face a mounting trade deficit and a devastated manufacturing base. With a lifetime of negotiating experience, the President understands how critical it is to put American workers and businesses first when it comes to trade. With tough and fair agreements, international trade can be used to grow our economy, return millions of jobs to America’s shores, and revitalize our nation’s suffering communities. This strategy starts by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and making certain that any new trade deals are in the interests of American workers. President Trump is committed to renegotiating NAFTA. If our partners refuse a renegotiation that gives American workers a fair deal, then the President will give notice of the United States’ intent to withdraw from NAFTA. In addition to rejecting and reworking failed trade deals, the United States will crack down on those nations that violate trade agreements and harm American workers in the process. The President will direct the Commerce Secretary to identify all trade violations and to use every tool at the federal government’s disposal to end these abuses. To carry out his strategy, the President is appointing the toughest and smartest to his trade team, ensuring that Americans have the best negotiators possible. For too long, trade deals have been negotiated by, and for, members of the Washington establishment.

safety and security of the American people.  In order to advise and assist me in executing this solemn responsibility, as well as to protect and advance the national interests of the United States at home and abroad, I hereby direct that my system for national security policy development and decision-making shall be organized as follows: The National Security Council, the Homeland Security Council, and Supporting Staff The National Security Act of 1947, as amended, established the National Security Council (NSC) to advise the President with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security.  There is also a Homeland Security Council (HSC) -- established through Executive Order 13228 of October 8, 2001, and subsequently codified in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 -- that has the purpose of advising the President on matters pertaining to homeland security.  Each Council is also responsible for the effective coordination of the security-related activities and functions of the executive departments and agencies. The security threats facing the United States in the 21st century transcend international boundaries.  Accordingly, the United States Government's decision-making structures and processes to address these challenges must remain equally adaptive and transformative.  Both Councils are statutory bodies that the President will continue to chair.  Invitations to participate in specific Council meetings shall be extended to those heads of executive departments and agencies, and other senior officials, who are needed to address the issue or issues under consideration.  When the President is absent from a meeting of either Council, the Vice President may preside at the President's direction. The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism (Homeland Security Advisor) shall be responsible, as appropriate and at the President's direction, for determining the agenda for the NSC or HSC, respectively, ensuring that the necessary papers are prepared, and recording Council actions and Presidential decisions in a timely manner.  When international economic issues are on the agenda of the NSC, the National Security Advisor and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy shall perform these tasks in concert. The NSC and HSC shall have as their regular attendees (both statutory and non-statutory) the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the National Security Advisor, the Homeland Security Advisor, and the Representative of the United States to the United Nations.  When international economic issues are on the agenda of the NSC, the NSC's regular attendees will include the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy.  The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisers to the NSC, shall also attend NSC meetings.  The Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, the Assistant to the President and Chief Strategist, the Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget are invited as attendees to any NSC meeting.  In addition to the NSC and HSC, there is also a single NSC staff within the Executive Office of the President that serves both the NSC and HSC.  The staff is composed of regional, issue-focused, and functional directorates and headed by a single civilian Executive Secretary, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 3021, who is also the Chief of Staff.  All policy and staff activity decisions will be transmitted to the Executive Secretary for appropriate distribution and awareness.  The purpose of the NSC staff is to advise me, the National Security Advisor, the Homeland Security Advisor, the NSC members, the HSC members, and others in the White House; to facilitate the implementation of Administration policy; and to help coordinate the national-security-related activities of the executive departments and agencies.  The Principals Committee The Principals Committee (PC) shall continue to serve as the Cabinet-level senior interagency forum for considering policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States.  The PC shall be convened and chaired by the National Security Advisor or the Homeland Security Advisor, as appropriate, in consultation with the appropriate attendees of the PC.  The Chair shall determine the agenda in consultation with the appropriate committee members, and the Executive Secretary shall ensure that necessary papers are prepared and that conclusions and decisions are communicated in a timely manner.  Invitations to participate in or attend a specific PC shall be extended at the discretion of the National Security Advisor and the Homeland Security Advisor, and may include those Cabinet-level heads of executive departments and agencies, and other senior officials, who are needed to address the issue under consideration. The PC shall have as its regular attendees the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff, the Assistant to the President and Chief Strategist, the National Security Advisor, and the Homeland Security Advisor.  The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed.  The Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may attend all PC meetings.  The Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor (Deputy National Security Advisor), the Deputy Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor to the Vice President, and the Executive Secretary (who shall serve as the Executive Secretary of the PC) shall attend all of the meetings of the PC, and the Representative of the United States to the United Nations and the Assistant to the President for Intragovernmental and Technology Initiatives may attend as appropriate. When international economic issues are on the agenda of the PC, the Committee's regular attendees will include the Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy (who shall serve as Chair for agenda items that principally pertain to international economics).\ The Deputies Committee The Deputies Committee (DC) shall continue to serve as the senior sub-Cabinet interagency forum for consideration of, and where appropriate, decision-making on, policy issues that affect the national security interests of the United States.  The DC shall be convened and chaired by the Deputy National Security Advisor or the Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Homeland Security Advisor (Deputy Homeland Security Advisor), as appropriate.  The Chair shall determine the agenda in consultation with the regular DC members, and the Executive Secretary shall ensure that necessary papers are prepared and that conclusions and decisions are communicated in a timely manner.  Invitations to participate in or attend a specific DC meeting shall be extended by the Chair to those at the Deputy or Under Secretary level of executive departments and agencies, and to other senior officials, who are needed to address the issue under consideration. The DC shall have as its regular members the Deputy Secretary of State, the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Attorney General, the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Deputy Director of National Intelligence, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  the Deputy Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor to the Vice President, the Deputy National Security Advisor, the Deputy Homeland Security Advisor, and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development. The Executive Secretary shall attend the DC meetings.  The Deputy Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs may attend all DC meetings.  The relevant Deputy Assistant to the President for the specific regional and functional issue under consideration shall also be invited to attend.  Likewise, when and where appropriate, the Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Planning, the Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Communication, the Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs, the Deputy Assistant to the President for Transnational Issues, and the Deputy Representative of the United States to the United Nations, shall also be invited to attend.  Other senior officials shall be invited where appropriate.  The DC shall review and monitor the work of the interagency national security process, including the interagency groups established pursuant to section D below.  The DC shall help to ensure that issues brought before the NSC, HSC, and PC have been properly analyzed and prepared for decision.  The DC shall also focus significant attention on monitoring the implementation of policies and decisions and shall conduct periodic reviews of the Administration's major national security and foreign policy initiatives.  The DC is responsible for establishing Policy Coordination Committees (PCCs) and for providing objectives and clear guidance. Policy Coordination Committees Management of the development and implementation of national security policies by multiple executive departments and agencies typically shall be accomplished by the PCCs, with participation primarily occurring at the Assistant Secretary level.  As the main day-to-day fora for interagency coordination of national security policies, the PCCs shall provide policy analysis for consideration by the more senior committees of the national security system and ensure timely responses to the President's decisions. Regional and issue-related PCCs shall be established at the direction of the DC.  Members of the NSC staff (or National Economic Council staff, as appropriate) will chair the PCCs; the DC, at its discretion, may add co-chairs to any PCC.  The PCCs shall review and coordinate the implementation of Presidential decisions in their respective policy areas.  The Chair of each PCC, in consultation with the Executive Secretary, shall invite representatives of other executive departments and agencies to attend meetings of the PCC where appropriate.  The Chair of each PCC, with the agreement of the Executive Secretary, may establish subordinate working groups to assist that PCC in the performance of its duties. An early meeting of the DC will be devoted to establishing the PCCs, determining their memberships, and providing them with mandates and strict guidance.  Until the DC has established otherwise, the existing system of Interagency Policy Committees shall continue. General The President and the Vice President may attend any and all meetings of any entity established by or under this memorandum. This document is part of a series of National Security Presidential Memoranda that shall replace both Presidential Policy Directives and Presidential Study Directives as the instrument for communicating relevant Presidential decisions.  This memorandum shall supersede all other existing Presidential guidance on the organization or support of the NSC and the HSC.  With regard to its application to economic matters, this document shall be interpreted in concert with any Executive Order governing the National Economic Council and with Presidential Memoranda signed hereafter that implement either this memorandum or that Executive Order. The Secretary of Defense is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.                               DONALD J.

Born in the Finger Lakes country of New York in 1800, Fillmore as a youth endured the privations of frontier life. He worked on his father's farm, and at 15 was apprenticed to a cloth dresser. He attended one-room schools, and fell in love with the redheaded teacher, Abigail Powers, who later became his wife. In 1823 he was admitted to the bar; seven years later he moved his law practice to Buffalo. As an associate of the Whig politician Thurlow Weed, Fillmore held state office and for eight years was a member of the House of Representatives. In 1848, while Comptroller of New York, he was elected Vice President. Fillmore presided over the Senate during the months of nerve-wracking debates over the Compromise of 1850. He made no public comment on the merits of the compromise proposals, but a few days before President Taylor's death, he intimated to him that if there should be a tie vote on Henry Clay's bill, he would vote in favor of it. Thus the sudden accession of Fillmore to the Presidency in July 1850 brought an abrupt political shift in the administration. Taylor's Cabinet resigned and President Fillmore at once appointed Daniel Webster to be Secretary of State, thus proclaiming his alliance with the moderate Whigs who favored the Compromise. A bill to admit California still aroused all the violent arguments for and against the extension of slavery, without any progress toward settling the major issues. Clay, exhausted, left Washington to recuperate, throwing leadership upon Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois. At this critical juncture, President Fillmore announced in favor of the Compromise. On August 6, 1850, he sent a message to Congress recommending that Texas be paid to abandon her claims to part of New Mexico. This helped influence a critical number of northern Whigs in Congress away from their insistence upon the Wilmot Proviso--the stipulation that all land gained by the Mexican War must be closed to slavery. Douglas's effective strategy in Congress combined with Fillmore's pressure from the White House to give impetus to the Compromise movement. Breaking up Clay's single legislative package, Douglas presented five separate bills to the Senate:    1. Admit California as a free state.    2. Settle the Texas boundary and compensate her.    3. Grant territorial status to New Mexico.    4. Place Federal officers at the disposal of slaveholders seeking fugitives.    5. Abolish the slave trade in the District of Columbia. Each measure obtained a majority, and by September 20, President Fillmore had signed them into law. Webster wrote, ""I can now sleep of nights."" Some of the more militant northern Whigs remained irreconcilable, refusing to forgive Fillmore for having signed the Fugitive Slave Act. They helped deprive him of the Presidential nomination in 1852. Within a few years it was apparent that although the Compromise had been intended to settle the slavery controversy, it served rather as an uneasy sectional truce. As the Whig Party disintegrated in the 1850's, Fillmore refused to join the Republican Party; but, instead, in 1856 accepted the nomination for President of the Know Nothing, or American, Party. Throughout the Civil War he opposed President Lincoln and during Reconstruction supported President Johnson. He died in 1874. United States of America,” by Frank Freidel  and Hugh Sidey.

Res. 42 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants (Rep. Brady, R-TX, and 25 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 44 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of the Interior Relating to Bureau of Land Management Regulations that Establish the Procedures Used to Prepare, Revise, or Amend Land Use Plans Pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (Rep. Cheney, R-WY, and 16 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 57 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Accountability and State Plans Under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (Rep. Rokita, R-IN, and 12 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 58 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Teacher Preparation Issues (Rep. Guthrie, R-KY, and 12 cosponsors)   The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act establish onerous reporting requirements and other constraints on States, local communities, and institutions of higher education. H.J. Res. 42 would nullify the Employment and Training Administration's Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants 81 Fed. Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Labor. The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by States when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested. The rule imposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. H.J. Res. 44 would nullify the final rule relating to Resource Management Planning, 81 Fed. Reg. 89580 (Dec. 12, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize regional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for activities on public lands. The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located mostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy and mineral development. Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes the rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities’ interests and could potentially dilute their input in planning decisions. H.J. Res. 57 would nullify the final rule Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act – Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86076 (Nov. 29, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes requirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have an accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student success, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student progress. While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local control of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas where the ESSA intended broad flexibility. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on how the Department of Education can support States and school districts as they implement the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. H.J. Res. 58 would nullify the final rule related to the Teacher Preparation Program Accountability System, 81 Fed. Reg. 75494 (Oct. 31, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes annual State reporting to measure the performance and quality of teacher preparation programs and tie them to program eligibility for participation in the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grant program. The rule imposes new burdensome and costly data reporting requirements on States and institutions of higher education. If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law.

Res. 42 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants (Rep. Brady, R-TX, and 25 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 44 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of the Interior Relating to Bureau of Land Management Regulations that Establish the Procedures Used to Prepare, Revise, or Amend Land Use Plans Pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (Rep. Cheney, R-WY, and 16 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 57 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Accountability and State Plans Under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (Rep. Rokita, R-IN, and 12 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 58 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Teacher Preparation Issues (Rep. Guthrie, R-KY, and 12 cosponsors)   The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act establish onerous reporting requirements and other constraints on States, local communities, and institutions of higher education. H.J. Res. 42 would nullify the Employment and Training Administration's Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants 81 Fed. Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Labor. The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by States when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested. The rule imposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. H.J. Res. 44 would nullify the final rule relating to Resource Management Planning, 81 Fed. Reg. 89580 (Dec. 12, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize regional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for activities on public lands. The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located mostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy and mineral development. Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes the rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities’ interests and could potentially dilute their input in planning decisions. H.J. Res. 57 would nullify the final rule Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act – Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed.

Kennedy John F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States (1961-1963), the youngest man elected to the office. On November 22, 1963, when he was hardly past his first thousand days in office, JFK was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, becoming also the youngest President to die. On November 22, 1963, when he was hardly past his first thousand days in office, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was killed by an assassin's bullets as his motorcade wound through Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was the youngest man elected President; he was the youngest to die. Of Irish descent, he was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917. Graduating from Harvard in 1940, he entered the Navy. In 1943, when his PT boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, Kennedy, despite grave injuries, led the survivors through perilous waters to safety. Back from the war, he became a Democratic Congressman from the Boston area, advancing in 1953 to the Senate. He married Jacqueline Bouvier on September 12, 1953. In 1955, while recuperating from a back operation, he wrote Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history. In 1956 Kennedy almost gained the Democratic nomination for Vice President, and four years later was a first-ballot nominee for President. Millions watched his television debates with the Republican candidate, Richard M. Nixon. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote, Kennedy became the first Roman Catholic President. His Inaugural Address offered the memorable injunction: ""Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country."" As President, he set out to redeem his campaign pledge to get America moving again. His economic programs launched the country on its longest sustained expansion since World War II; before his death, he laid plans for a massive assault on persisting pockets of privation and poverty. Responding to ever more urgent demands, he took vigorous action in the cause of equal rights, calling for new civil rights legislation. His vision of America extended to the quality of the national culture and the central role of the arts in a vital society. He wished America to resume its old mission as the first nation dedicated to the revolution of human rights. With the Alliance for Progress and the Peace Corps, he brought American idealism to the aid of developing nations. But the hard reality of the Communist challenge remained. Shortly after his inauguration, Kennedy permitted a band of Cuban exiles, already armed and trained, to invade their homeland. The attempt to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro was a failure. Soon thereafter, the Soviet Union renewed its campaign against West Berlin. Kennedy replied by reinforcing the Berlin garrison and increasing the Nation's military strength, including new efforts in outer space. Confronted by this reaction, Moscow, after the erection of the Berlin Wall, relaxed its pressure in central Europe. Instead, the Russians now sought to install nuclear missiles in Cuba. When this was discovered by air reconnaissance in October 1962, Kennedy imposed a quarantine on all offensive weapons bound for Cuba. While the world trembled on the brink of nuclear war, the Russians backed down and agreed to take the missiles away. The American response to the Cuban crisis evidently persuaded Moscow of the futility of nuclear blackmail. Kennedy now contended that both sides had a vital interest in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and slowing the arms race--a contention which led to the test ban treaty of 1963. The months after the Cuban crisis showed significant progress toward his goal of ""a world of law and free choice, banishing the world of war and coercion."" His administration thus saw the beginning of new hope for both the equal rights of Americans and the peace of the world.

President John F. Kennedy famously suggested the American people: “Ask what you can do for your country.” In 1961, the Peace Corps was created, facilitating service among citizens working toward peace in developing countries. In 2011, President Obama celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Peace Corps with a Presidential Proclamation.

Kennedy signed an Executive Order establishing the Peace Corps, forever changing the way America sees the world and the world sees us.  Today, one of President Kennedy's most enduring legacies can be found in the over 200,000 current and returned Peace Corps Volunteers who have collectively given over a half century of service to the cause of peace.  On its 50th anniversary, the United States Peace Corps remains an enduring symbol of our Nation's commitment to encouraging progress, creating opportunity, and fostering mutual respect and understanding throughout the world. Over the past five decades, Peace Corps Volunteers have served in nearly 140 countries, bringing a wealth of practical assistance to those working to build better lives for themselves and their communities.  From the first group of volunteers to arrive in Ghana and Tanzania in August 1961, they have been emissaries of hope and goodwill to the far corners of our world, strengthening the ties of friendship between the people of the United States and those of other countries.  Living and working alongside those they serve, volunteers help address changing and complex global needs in education, health and HIV/AIDS, business and information technology, agriculture, environmental protection, and youth development.  With each village that now has access to clean water, each young woman who has received an education, and each family empowered to prevent disease because of the service of a Peace Corps Volunteer, President Kennedy's noble vision lives on. In our increasingly interconnected world, the mission of the Peace Corps is more relevant today than ever.  Returned volunteers, enriched by their experiences overseas, bring a deeper understanding of other cultures and traditions back to their home communities in the United States.  The lasting accomplishments of the Peace Corps continue to strengthen partnerships with leaders and countries around the world.  This year, we also mourn the loss and pay tribute to the extraordinary life of Sargent Shriver, the founding director of the Peace Corps.  The impact of his decades of public service will echo forever in countless places across the globe that have been touched by the Peace Corps. On this anniversary, we honor the men and women from across the country who have carried forward our Nation's finest tradition of service, and we rededicate ourselves to fulfilling the dream and continuing the work of all those who aspire and yearn for peace. NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 1, 2011, as the 50th Anniversary of the Peace Corps.  I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor the Peace Corps and its volunteers, past and present, for their many contributions to the cause of global peace and friendship. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand eleven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.

[[nid:7808]] ""How can I help?"" That's what former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton both asked as the devastating impact of the earthquake in Haiti became clear.  This question brought them to a place they both know well, the Oval Office. There they met with President Obama and agreed to lead a major fundraising effort for relief: the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. In the Rose Garden just after the meeting, President Bush touched on the work that's already being done and the best way for Americans to help: The challenges down there are immense, but there's a lot of devoted people leading the relief effort, from government personnel who deployed into the disaster zone to the faith-based groups that have made Haiti a calling. The most effective way for Americans to help the people of Haiti is to contribute money. That money will go to organizations on the ground and will be -- who will be able to effectively spend it. I know a lot of people want to send blankets or water -- just send your cash. One of the things that the President and I will do is to make sure your money is spent wisely. As President Obama said, you can look us up on clintonbushhaitifund.org.   President Clinton reaffirmed his optimism for Haiti's future, despite this enormous challenge for the country: I believe before this earthquake Haiti had the best chance in my lifetime to escape its history -- a history that Hillary and I have shared a tiny part of. I still believe that. The Haitians want to just amend their development plan to take account of what's happened in Port-au-Prince and west, figure out what they got to do about that, and then go back to implementing it. But it's going to take a lot of help and a long time.   President Obama summed up the importance of the sustained attention and support the two former Presidents will champion: In any extraordinary catastrophe like this, the first several weeks are just going to involve getting immediate relief on the ground. And there are going to be some tough days over the next several days. People are still trying to figure out how to organize themselves. There's going to be fear, anxiety, a sense of desperation in some cases. I've been in contact with President Préval. I've been talking to the folks on the ground. We are going to be making slow and steady progress, and the key now is to -- for everybody in Haiti to understand that there is going to be sustained help on the way. But what these gentlemen are going to be able to do is when the news media starts seeing its attention drift to other things but there's still enormous needs on the ground, these two gentlemen of extraordinary stature I think are going to be able to help ensure that these efforts are sustained. And that's why it's so important and that's why I'm so grateful that they agreed to do it.   Watch video of the announcement and read the remarks below: [[nid:7806]]   January 16, 2010 REMARKS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON, AND FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH ON THE RECOVERY AND REBUILDING EFFORT IN HAITI Rose Garden 11:02 A.M. EST PRESIDENT OBAMA: Good morning, everybody. In times of great challenge in our country and around the world, Americans have always come together to lend a hand and to serve others and to do what's right. That's what the American people have been doing in recent days with their extraordinary generosity and contributions to the Haitian people. At this moment, we're moving forward with one of the largest relief efforts in our history -- to save lives and to deliver relief that averts an even larger catastrophe. The two leaders with me today will ensure that this is matched by a historic effort that extends beyond our government, because America has no greater resource than the strength and the compassion of the American people. We just met in the Oval Office -- an office they both know well. And I'm pleased that President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton have agreed to lead a major fundraising effort for relief: the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. On behalf of the American people, I want to thank both of you for returning to service and leading this urgent mission. This is a model that works. After the terrible tsunami in Asia, President Bush turned to President Clinton and the first President Bush to lead a similar fund. That effort raised substantial resources for the victims of that disaster -- money that helped save lives, deliver aid, and rebuild communities. And that's exactly what the people of Haiti desperately need right now. Every day that goes by, we learn more about the horrifying scope of this catastrophe -- destruction and suffering that defies comprehension. Entire communities buried under mountains of concrete. Families sleeping in the streets. Injured desperate for care. Many thousands feared dead. That's why thousands of American personnel -- civilian and military -- are on the scene working to distribute clean drinking water and food and medicine, and thousands of tons of emergency food supplies are arriving every day. It will be difficult. It is an enormous challenge to distribute this aid quickly and safely in a place that has suffered such destruction. That's what we're focused on now -- working closely with our partners: the Haitian government, the United Nations, and many organizations and nations -- friends from Argentina and France, from Dominican Republic and Brazil, and countries all around the world. And Secretary Hillary Clinton will be in Haiti today to meet with President Préval and continue our close coordination with his government. But we also know that our longer-term effort will not be measured in days and weeks; it will be measured in months and even years. And that's why it's so important to enlist and sustain the support of the American people. That's why it's so important to have a point of coordination for all the support that extends beyond our government. Here at home, Presidents Bush and Clinton will help the American people to do their part, because responding to a disaster must be the work of all of us. Indeed, those wrenching scenes of devastation remind us not only of our common humanity but also of our common responsibilities. This time of suffering can and must be a time of compassion. As the scope of the destruction became apparent, I spoke to each of these gentlemen, and they each asked the same simple question: How can I help? In the days ahead they'll be asking everyone what they can do -- individuals, corporations, NGOs, and institutions. And I urge everyone who wants to help to visit www.clintonbushhaitifund.org. We're fortunate to have the service of these two leaders. President Bush led America's response to the Asian tsunami, aid and relief that prevented even greater loss of life in the months after that disaster. And his administration's efforts to fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa treated more than 10 million men, women, and children. As President, Bill Clinton helped restore democracy in Haiti. As a private citizen, he has helped to save the lives of millions of people around the world. And as the United Nations special envoy to Haiti, he understands intimately the daily struggles and needs of the Haitian people. And by coming together in this way, these two leaders send an unmistakable message to the people of Haiti and to the people of the world: In these difficult hours, America stands united. We stand united with the people of Haiti, who have shown such incredible resilience, and we will help them to recover and to rebuild. Yesterday we witnessed a small but remarkable display of that determination -- some of you may have seen it -- Haitians with little more than the clothes on their back marched peacefully through a ruined neighborhood, and despite all their loss and all their suffering they sang songs of faith and songs of hope. These are the people we're called upon to help. Those are the hopes that we're committed to answering. That's why the three of us are standing together today. And with that, I would invite each President to say a few words. I'm going to start with President Bush. PRESIDENT BUSH: I join President Obama in expressing my sympathy for the people of Haiti. I commend the President for his swift and timely response to the disaster. I am so pleased to answer the call to work alongside President Clinton to mobilize the compassion of the American people. Like most Americans, Laura and I have been following the television coverage from Haiti. Our hearts are broken when we see the scenes of little children struggling without a mom or a dad, or the bodies in the streets or the physical damage of the earthquake. The challenges down there are immense, but there's a lot of devoted people leading the relief effort, from government personnel who deployed into the disaster zone to the faith-based groups that have made Haiti a calling. The most effective way for Americans to help the people of Haiti is to contribute money. That money will go to organizations on the ground and will be -- who will be able to effectively spend it. I know a lot of people want to send blankets or water -- just send your cash. One of the things that the President and I will do is to make sure your money is spent wisely. As President Obama said, you can look us up on clintonbushhaitifund.org. The Haitian people have got a tough journey, yet it's amazing how terrible tragedies can bring out the best of the human spirit. We've all seen that firsthand when American citizens responded to the tsunami or to Katrina or to the earthquake in Pakistan. And President Clinton and I are going to work to tap that same spirit of giving to help our brothers and sisters in the Caribbean. Toward the end of my presidency, Laura made a trip down to Haiti to look at the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief programs down there. I remember clearly her coming back and telling me about the energy and optimism of the people of Haiti. There's just an unbelievable spirit amongst the Haitian people. And while that earthquake destroyed a lot, it didn't destroy their spirit. So the people of Haiti will recovery and rebuild, and as they do they know they'll have a friend in the United States of America. Mr. President, thank you for giving me the chance to serve. PRESIDENT CLINTON: First, I want to thank President Obama for asking President Bush and me to do this, and for what I believe has been a truly extraordinary response on the part of the American government. Because I've been working down there for nearly a year as the U.N. special envoy, I've been in constant touch with our people through the U.N. on the ground, and you know we lost a lot of our people there -- the largest loss of life in the history of the United Nations on a single day. The United States has been there from the beginning. The military has been great. The response by the State Department and AID has been great. I just can't say enough about it. And the people in Haiti know it, and I'm grateful. Secondly, I'd like to thank President Bush for agreeing to do this, and for the concern he showed for Haiti. Before this happened, my foundation worked with the PEPFAR people on the AIDS problems in Haiti and I saw how good they were and what they did and how many lives they saved. Finally, let me say that -- I don't have to read the Web site because they did -- but I want to say something about this. Right now all we need to do is get food and medicine and water and a secure place for them to be. But when we start the rebuilding effort, we want to do what I did with the President's father in the tsunami area. We want to be a place where people can know their money will be well spent; where we will ensure the ongoing integrity of the process. And we want to stay with this over the long run. My job with the U.N. basically is not at all in conflict with this because I'm sort of the outside guy. My job is to work with the donor nations, the international agencies, the business people around the world to try to get them to invest there, the nongovernmental organizations, the Haitian diaspora community. I believe before this earthquake Haiti had the best chance in my lifetime to escape its history -- a history that Hillary and I have shared a tiny part of. I still believe that. The Haitians want to just amend their development plan to take account of what's happened in Port-au-Prince and west, figure out what they got to do about that, and then go back to implementing it. But it's going to take a lot of help and a long time. So I'm just grateful that President Bush wants to help, and I've already figured out how I can get him to do some things that he didn't sign on for. (Laughter.) Again, I have no words to say what I feel like. When you -- I was in those hotels that collapsed. I had meals with people who are dead. The cathedral church that Hillary and I sat in 34 years ago is a total rubble. But what these men have said is true: It is still one of the most remarkable, unique places I have ever been. And they can escape their history and build a better future if we do our part. And President Obama, thank you for giving us a chance to do a little of that. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, these gentlemen are going to do an extraordinary job, but really what they're going to be doing is just tapping into the incredible generosity, the ingenuity, the can-do spirit of the American people in helping our neighbors in need. So I want to thank each of them not only for being here today but what I know is going to be an extraordinary effort. I want to make sure that everybody got that Web site one more time. Obviously we're just standing it up, but it will immediately give people a means to contact our offices -- www.clintonbushhaitifund.org. And I just want to amplify one thing that was said. We were talking in the back. In any extraordinary catastrophe like this, the first several weeks are just going to involve getting immediate relief on the ground. And there are going to be some tough days over the next several days. People are still trying to figure out how to organize themselves. There's going to be fear, anxiety, a sense of desperation in some cases. I've been in contact with President Préval. I've been talking to the folks on the ground. We are going to be making slow and steady progress, and the key now is to -- for everybody in Haiti to understand that there is going to be sustained help on the way. But what these gentlemen are going to be able to do is when the news media starts seeing its attention drift to other things but there's still enormous needs on the ground, these two gentlemen of extraordinary stature I think are going to be able to help ensure that these efforts are sustained. And that's why it's so important and that's why I'm so grateful that they agreed to do it. Thank you, gentlemen. END 11:16 A.M.

""People and nations are forged in the fires of adversity,"" he said, doubtless thinking of his own as well as the American experience. Adams was born in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1735. A Harvard-educated lawyer, he early became identified with the patriot cause; a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses, he led in the movement for independence. During the Revolutionary War he served in France and Holland in diplomatic roles, and helped negotiate the treaty of peace. From 1785 to 1788 he was minister to the Court of St. James's, returning to be elected Vice President under George Washington. Adams' two terms as Vice President were frustrating experiences for a man of his vigor, intellect, and vanity. He complained to his wife Abigail, ""My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived."" When Adams became President, the war between the French and British was causing great difficulties for the United States on the high seas and intense partisanship among contending factions within the Nation. His administration focused on France, where the Directory, the ruling group, had refused to receive the American envoy and had suspended commercial relations. Adams sent three commissioners to France, but in the spring of 1798 word arrived that the French Foreign Minister Talleyrand and the Directory had refused to negotiate with them unless they would first pay a substantial bribe. Adams reported the insult to Congress, and the Senate printed the correspondence, in which the Frenchmen were referred to only as ""X, Y, and Z."" The Nation broke out into what Jefferson called ""the X. Y. Z. fever,"" increased in intensity by Adams's exhortations. The populace cheered itself hoarse wherever the President appeared. Never had the Federalists been so popular. Congress appropriated money to complete three new frigates and to build additional ships, and authorized the raising of a provisional army. It also passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, intended to frighten foreign agents out of the country and to stifle the attacks of Republican editors. President Adams did not call for a declaration of war, but hostilities began at sea. At first, American shipping was almost defenseless against French privateers, but by 1800 armed merchantmen and U.S. warships were clearing the sea-lanes. Despite several brilliant naval victories, war fever subsided. Word came to Adams that France also had no stomach for war and would receive an envoy with respect. Long negotiations ended the quasi war. Sending a peace mission to France brought the full fury of the Hamiltonians against Adams. In the campaign of 1800 the Republicans were united and effective, the Federalists badly divided. Nevertheless, Adams polled only a few less electoral votes than Jefferson, who became President. On November 1, 1800, just before the election, Adams arrived in the new Capital City to take up his residence in the White House. On his second evening in its damp, unfinished rooms, he wrote his wife, ""Before I end my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof."" Adams retired to his farm in Quincy. Here he penned his elaborate letters to Thomas Jefferson. Here on July 4, 1826, he whispered his last words: ""Thomas Jefferson survives."" But Jefferson had died at Monticello a few hours earlier.

Originally built for the State, War and Navy Departments between 1871 and 1888, the EEOB is an impressive building that commands a unique position in both our national history and architectural heritage. Designed by Supervising Architect of the Treasury Alfred Mullett, the granite, slate and cast iron exterior makes the EEOB one of America's best examples of the French Second Empire style of architecture. It took 17 years for Mullett's masterpiece to finally be completed. Take a tour of the EEOB here. History Next door to the White House, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB) commands a unique position in both our national history and architectural heritage. Designed by Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Alfred B. Mullett, it was built from 1871 to 1888 to house the growing staffs of the State, War, and Navy Departments, and is considered one of the best examples of French Second Empire architecture in the country. In bold contrast to many of the somber classical revival buildings in Washington, the EEOB's flamboyant style epitomizes the optimism and exuberance of the post-Civil War period. The State, War, and Navy Building, as it was originally known, housed the three Executive Branch Departments most intimately associated with formulating and conducting the nation's foreign policy in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century -- the period when the United States emerged as an international power. The building has housed some of the nation's most significant diplomats and politicians and has been the scene of many historic events. The history of the EEOB began long before its foundations were laid. The first executive offices were constructed on sites flanking the White House between 1799 and 1820. A series of fires (including those set by the British in 1814) and overcrowded conditions led to the construction of the existing Treasury Building. In 1866, the construction of the North Wing of the Treasury Building necessitated the demolition of the State Department building to the northeast of the White House. The State Department then moved to the D.C. Orphan Asylum Building while the War and Navy Departments continued to make do with their cramped quarters to the west of the White House. In December of 1869, Congress appointed a commission to select a site and prepare plans and cost estimates for a new State Department Building. The commission was also to consider possible arrangements for the War and Navy Departments. To the horror of some who expected a Greek Revival twin of the Treasury Building to be erected on the other side of the White House, the elaborate French Second Empire style design by Alfred Mullett was selected, and construction of a building to house all three departments began in June of 1871. Construction took 17 years as the building slowly rose wing by wing. When the EEOB was finished in 1888, it was the largest office building in Washington, with nearly 2 miles of black and white tiled corridors. Almost all of the interior detail is of cast iron or plaster; the use of wood was minimized to insure fire safety. Eight monumental curving staircases of granite with over 4,000 individually cast bronze balusters are capped by four skylight domes and two stained glass rotundas. Completed in 1875, the State Department's south wing was the first to be occupied, with its elegant four-story library (completed in 1876), Diplomatic Reception Room, and Secretary's office decorated with carved wood, Oriental rugs, and stenciled wall patterns. The Navy Department moved into the east wing in 1879, where elaborate wall and ceiling stenciling and marqetry floors decorated the office of the Secretary. The Indian Treaty Room, originally the Navy's library and reception room, cost more per square foot than any other room in the building because of its rich marble wall panels, tiled floors, 800-pound bronze sconces, and gold leaf ornamentation. This room has been the scene of many Presidential news conferences and continues to be used for conferences and receptions attended by the President. The remaining north, west, and center wings were constructed for the War Department and took an additional 10 years to build. Notable interiors include an ornate cast-iron library, the Secretary's suite, and the stained glass skylight over the west wing's double staircase. Many of our most celebrated national figures have participated in historical events that have taken place within the EEOB's granite walls. Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson,Gerald Ford, and George H. W. Bush all had offices in this building before becoming President. It has housed 16 Secretaries of the Navy, 21 Secretaries of War, and 24 Secretaries of State. Winston Churchill once walked its corridors and Japanese emissaries met here with Secretary of State Cordell Hull after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. President Herbert Hoover occupied the Secretary of Navy's office for a few months following a fire in the Oval Office on Christmas Eve 1929. In recent history, President Richard Nixon had a private office here. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was the first in a succession of Vice Presidents to the present day that have had offices in the building. Gradually, the original tenants of the EEOB vacated the building - the Navy Department left in 1918 (except for the Secretary who stayed until 1921), followed by the War Department in 1938, and finally by the State Department in 1947. The White House began to move some of its offices across West Executive Avenue in 1939, and in 1949 the building was turned over to the Executive Office of the President and renamed the Executive Office Building. The building continues to house various agencies that comprise the Executive Office of the President, such as the White House Office, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget, and the National Security Council. The French Second Empire style originated in Europe, where it first appeared during the rebuilding of Paris in the 1850s and 60s. Based upon French Renaissance prototypes, such as the Louvre Palace, the Second Empire style is characterized by the use of a steep mansard roof, central and end pavilions, and an elaborately sculptured facade. Its sophistication appealed to visiting foreigners, especially in England and America, where as early as the late 1850s, architects began adopting isolated features and, eventually, the style as a coherent whole. Alfred Mullett's interpretation of the French Second Empire style was, however, particularly Americanized in its lack of an ornate sculptural program and its bold, linear details. While it was only a project on the drafting table, the design of the EEOB was subject to controversy. When it was completed in 1888, the Second Empire style had fallen from favor, and Mullett's masterpiece was perceived by capricious Victorians as only an embarrassing reminder of past whims in architectural preference. This was especially the case with the EEOB, since previous plans for a building on the same site had been in the Greek Revivial style of the Treasury Building. In 1917, the Commission of Fine Arts requested John Russell Pope to prepare sketches of the State, War, and Navy building that incorporated Classical facades. During the same year, Washington architect Waddy B. Wood completed a drawing depicting the building remodeled to resemble the Treasury Building. This project was revived in 1930 when Congress appropriated $3 million for its construction. Wood worked for 3 years on the design to remove the granite walls and replace them with marble, but the project was shelved due to financial burdens imposed by the Great Depression. In 1957, President Eisenhower's Advisory Committee on Presidential Office Space recommended demolition of the Executive Office Building and construction of a modern office facility. However, the public outcry, and the overwhelming expenses associated with the demolition, saved the building. The building has not been without detractors. It has been referred to as Mullett's ""architectural infant asylum"" by writer Henry Adams. President Harry S. Truman came to the defense of the building when it was threatened by demolition in 1958. He said it was ""the greatest monstrosity in America"". Noted architectural historian Henry-Russell Hitchcock, however described it as ""perhaps the best extant example in America of the second empire."" The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1969. In 1972, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites. Since 1981, the Office of Administration of the Executive Office of the President has actively pursued a rigorous program of rehabilitation of the EEOB. The entire structure has benefited from an upgraded maintenance program that has also included restoration of some of the EEOB's most spectacular historic interiors. In 1988, Congress enacted legislation to allow the Office of Administration to accept gifts and loans from the public on behalf of the EEOB to be used for preservation and restoration purposes. Persons interested in finding out more about the preservation program or in making a contribution should contact the Preservation Office.

She served as First Lady from 1915 to 1921. After the President suffered a severe stroke, she pre-screened all matters of state, functionally running the Executive branch of government for the remainder of Wilson's second term. ""Secret President,"" ""first woman to run the government"" -- so legend has labeled a First Lady whose role gained unusual significance when her husband suffered prolonged and disabling illness. A happy, protected childhood and first marriage had prepared Edith Wilson for the duties of helpmate and hostess; widowhood had taught her something of business matters. Descendant of Virginia aristocracy, she was born in Wytheville in 1872, seventh among eleven children of Sallie White and Judge William Holcombe Bolling. Until the age of 12 she never left the town; at 15 she went to Martha Washington College to study music, with a second year at a smaller school in Richmond. Visiting a married sister in Washington, pretty young Edith met a businessman named Norman Galt; in 1896 they were married. For 12 years she lived as a contented (though childless) young matron in the capital, with vacations abroad. In 1908 her husband died unexpectedly. Shrewdly, Edith Galt chose a good manager who operated the family's jewelry firm with financial success. By a quirk of fate and a chain of friendships, Mrs. Galt met the bereaved President, still mourning profoundly for his first wife. A man who depended on feminine companionship, the lonely Wilson took an instant liking to Mrs. Galt, charming and intelligent and unusually pretty. Admiration changed swiftly to love. In proposing to her, he made the poignant statement that ""in this place time is not measured by weeks, or months, or years, but by deep human experiences..."" They were married privately on December 18, 1915, at her home; and after they returned from a brief honeymoon in Virginia, their happiness made a vivid impression on their friends and White House staff. Though the new First Lady had sound qualifications for the role of hostess, the social aspect of the administration was overshadowed by the war in Europe and abandoned after the United States entered the conflict in 1917. Edith Wilson submerged her own life in her husband's, trying to keep him fit under tremendous strain. She accompanied him to Europe when the Allies conferred on terms of peace. Wilson returned to campaign for Senate approval of the peace treaty and the League of Nations Covenant. His health failed in September 1919; a stroke left him partly paralyzed. His constant attendant, Mrs. Wilson took over many routine duties and details of government. But she did not initiate programs or make major decisions, and she did not try to control the executive branch. She selected matters for her husband's attention and let everything else go to the heads of departments or remain in abeyance. Her ""stewardship,"" she called this. And in My Memoir, published in 1939, she stated emphatically that her husband's doctors had urged this course upon her. In 1921, the Wilsons retired to a comfortable home in Washington, where he died three years later. A highly respected figure in the society of the capital, Mrs. Wilson lived on to ride in President Kennedy's inaugural parade. She died later in 1961: on December 28, the anniversary of her famous husband's birth.  The biographies of the First Ladies on WhiteHouse.gov are from “The First Ladies of the United States of America,” by Allida Black.

""I think I am more like a state prisoner than anything else, there is certain bounds set for me which I must not depart from..."" So in one of her surviving letters, Martha Washington confided to a niece that she did not entirely enjoy her role as first of First Ladies. She once conceded that ""many younger and gayer women would be extremely pleased"" in her place; she would ""much rather be at home."" But when George Washington took his oath of office in New York City on April 30, 1789, and assumed the new duties of President of the United States, his wife brought to their position a tact and discretion developed over 58 years of life in Tidewater Virginia society. Oldest daughter of John and Frances Dandridge, she was born June 2, 1731, on a plantation near Williamsburg. Typical for a girl in an 18th-century family, her education was almost negligible except in domestic and social skills, but she learned all the arts of a well-ordered household and how to keep a family contented. As a girl of 18--about five feet tall, dark-haired, gentle of manner--she married the wealthy Daniel Parke Custis. Two babies died; two were hardly past infancy when her husband died in 1757. From the day Martha married George Washington in 1759, her great concern was the comfort and happiness of her husband and children. When his career led him to the battlegrounds of the Revolutionary War and finally to the Presidency, she followed him bravely. Her love of private life equaled her husband's; but, as she wrote to her friend Mercy Otis Warren, ""I cannot blame him for having acted according to his ideas of duty in obeying the voice of his country."" As for herself, ""I am still determined to be cheerful and happy, in whatever situation I may be; for I have also learned from experience that the greater part of our happiness or misery depends upon our dispositions, and not upon our circumstances."" At the President's House in temporary capitals, New York and Philadelphia, the Washingtons chose to entertain in formal style, deliberately emphasizing the new republic's wish to be accepted as the equal of the established governments of Europe. Still, Martha's warm hospitality made her guests feel welcome and put strangers at ease. She took little satisfaction in "" formal compliments and empty ceremonies"" and declared that ""I am fond of only what comes from the heart."" Abigail Adams, who sat at her right during parties and receptions, praised her as ""one of those unassuming characters which create Love and Esteem."" In 1797 the Washingtons said farewell to public life and returned to their beloved Mount Vernon, to live surrounded by kinfolk, friends, and a constant stream of guests eager to pay their respects to the celebrated couple. Martha's daughter Patsy had died, her son Jack at 26, but Jack's children figured in the household. After George Washington died in 1799, Martha assured a final privacy by burning their letters; she died of ""severe fever"" on May 22, 1802. Both lie buried at Mount Vernon, where Washington himself had planned an unpretentious tomb for them.

Every one of them who worked for Gorsuch since he became a judge in 2006 — with the exception of two now clerking at the Supreme Court — signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday heralding his independence that “will never waver.” ... In their letter, the former law clerks stressed Gorsuch’s strict adherence to the Constitution and the rule of law, regardless of his opinions. “As law clerks who have worked at his side, we know that Judge Gorsuch never resolves a case by the light of his personal view of what the law should be,” they said. “Nor does he ever bend the law to reach a particular result he desires.” “He has never feared staking out a principled position ... even if he had to do so alone,” they wrote. “If confirmed, we are confident that Judge Gorsuch’s independence — grounded in the limited powers granted to the judiciary by the Constitution — will never waver.” Read USA Today's article about the letter here.

Brady Press Briefing Room 1:09 P.M. EST Good afternoon.  I know you’re all looking forward to what promises to be a historic night for the nation and for this President.  The President is very excited to make his announcement of the next Associate Justice to the Supreme Court later this evening. According to some polls -- and you know we love polls around here -- for 70 percent of the voters, the President's choice for Supreme Court was an important factor in their choice at the ballot box in November.  For more than one in five, it was the most important factor.  Tonight, he will formally present his nominee to the American people, and I can assure you that this individual will make those voters and every American very, very proud. This particular choice is one that the President takes very seriously.  He knows it will impact the course of our country’s jurisprudence for generations to come.  As such, he's taken careful steps to ensure that this process has both been transparent and inclusive.  He has been speaking about the list of individuals that he may nominate since May of this year, and, after consulting with several influential groups, released a definitive list of 21 in September, pledging that his nominee will solely come from that list.  He sought the advice and consent of both Republicans and Democrats, senators throughout this process. The President recognizes the gravity of his choice to fill the seat left by Justice Scalia, one of the most steadfast protectors of our liberty and devotees of our Constitution that ever graced the bench.  Whomever the President selects will be a worthy successor to the brilliant legal mind and constitutional dedication of Justice Scalia. It's our intention to start promptly tonight in the East Room at 8:02 p.m.  Pre-set will begin at 6:30.  The East Room will be available for live shots approximately 20 minutes following the announcement, and both the Briefing Room and Pebble Beach outside have extended hours tonight to accommodate any additional journalistic needs.  We'll have further guidance on tonight’s plans as the day evolves. Moving to the news of the day, I know that Secretary Kelly, alongside other DHS officials, just recently concluded a briefing on the operational implementation of the President’s executive order.  I think it’s pretty clear from the Secretary’s press conference that this executive order was enacted with the proper preparation and coordination between the White House and DHS, and that implementation will continue and proceed as planned. We also have a few updates on the leadership of some of our most critical government agencies.  Last night, as you know, the President relieved Sally Yates of her duties as acting Attorney General and named Dana Boente, as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as the acting Attorney General until Democratic senators finally quit their obstruction and confirm the unquestionably qualified Senator Jeff Sessions as our next Attorney General. Ms. Yates failed to enforce a legal order, approved by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel and designed to protect the citizens of the United States.  Calling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven nations is not extreme.  It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country. Around 9:00 p.m. last night, the President signed an affidavit of nomination for Mr. Boente.  As one of his first official actions in his new post as acting Attorney General, he signed a memorandum rescinding Sally Yates’ guidance regarding the President’s executive order to ensure its full implementation. Last night, the President also announced the appointment of Thomas Homan as Acting Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security and Director of ICE.  Mr. Homan has had a long career at ICE, most recently serving as the Executive Associate Director for Enforcement and Removal Operations.  Having a professional in place like this go serve as the acting director is critical to ensuring the efficient administration of the President’s agenda. One other update on a story from yesterday. I hope you all saw the statement that was put out from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where Chairman Dunford noted -- discussed the reorganization of the National Security Council.  And he made it clear that he continues to fully participate in the interagency process and provide the best possible military advice to the President and members of the NSC.  I really hope that that statement closes the book on the misleading narrative, and this should hopefully be the final time that we have to address what was in the national security directive. The family of the President -- excuse me, the President also had a very somber and lengthy conversation with the family of [Navy] Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owens.  The President offered his sincerest condolences to Officer Owens’s wife, his father, and their three children.  Chief Owens was on his 12th deployment, from what I understand.  We could never repay the debt of gratitude we owe him, the freedom that he fought for, and the sacrifice that he made, as well as the other members of his unit who were injured in this operation. Today in the Senate, two of the President’s nominees advanced out of the committee.  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the nominations of both Congressman Ryan Zinke as the next Interior Secretary and the nomination of former Texas Governor Rick Perry as the next Secretary of Energy.  Elaine Chao also gratefully received the approval of the full Senate to become the next Secretary of Transportation.  I expect further guidance on her official swearing-in to come very soon. The Senate Democrats have done everything in their power to slow the work of the Senate, while the President continues to take decisive action, just like he promised.  So it's unfortunate that Senate Democrats remain so out of touch with the message that the American people sent this past November -- that people want change.  President Trump is delivering that change, and the only response from Senate Democrats so far is to try to stall the core functions of our government. I know that I’ve repeated this every day, but honestly it’s getting a bit ridiculous.  The idea that these highly qualified nominees have the votes for their nominations to be endorsed out of committee and get a full vote are being stalled because Democrats are boycotting the committee vote is outrageous.  The mere idea that they're not even showing up to hearings is truly outrageous.  So I'd like to give a special shout-out to the folks at C-SPAN for making sure that all of these embarrassing actions by Senate Democrats get the wall-to-wall coverage that they deserve.  Voters are going to remember what senators stood in the way of when President Trump -- by President Trump trying to install his agency and department leaders the next time their name is on a ballot. I don’t mean to sound like a broken record, but the numbers don’t lie.  Sixteen of President Trump’s nominees to head major department or agencies are still waiting to be confirmed.  At the same time in 2009, President Obama only had seven of these people awaiting confirmation.  In 2001, President Bush had all but two. Moving on, here at the White House, this morning, we reiterated the President’s intention to continue to enforce the executive order protecting employees from the anti-LGBTQ discrimination while working for the federal government or contractors. Also this morning, the President had a breakfast and listening session with major pharmaceutical company executives in the Roosevelt Room:  Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Celgene, Amgen, Eli Lilly, and the PhRMA trade group were represented at the meeting.  Chairman Greg Walden, Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, also participated.  During the meeting, the President commended their progress in lowering drugs prices but also reiterated his insistence that there is more work to be done.  He promised to continue reducing the burdensome regulations that raise the cost of doing business in America. He was pleased to hear that the Chairman of Amgen, Robert Bradway, discussed how 1,600 American jobs will be added by Amgen.  This administration will continue to prioritize jobs and make it easier for businesses around this country to hire more Americans.  The President had lunch with Mayor Giuliani just a short time ago, who serves as the CEO of an international security firm, Giuliani Partners, and was tapped by the President to lend his expertise to the administration's cyber efforts.  Mayor Giuliani was asked to initiate this process because of his long and very successful government career in law enforcement and his 15 years private sector security, providing solutions for the challenges that we face in the cyber world. During the transition, the President announced that he intended to host a series of meetings with senior corporate executives from companies that are facing challenges, such as hacking, intrusions, disruptions, manipulations, theft of data and identities, and securing information from technological infrastructures.  These are the same challenges facing the government that are facing public entities and businesses, and the President believes that solutions to these issues will often come from the private sector. Following the lunch with Mayor Giuliani, the President will host a listening session with these cybersecurity experts and Mayor Giuliani.  No consensus or advice on the recommendations resulting from the group are wildly expected, but we do expect a spirited and wide-ranging discussion regarding the growing cybersecurity threats that our nation is facing. Later this afternoon, the President will sign an executive order -- or potentially sign one -- the federal government cybersecurity efforts, and give leaders the tools they need to keep the country safe from cyberattacks. The order does three main things:  It secures the federal networks we operate on behalf of the American people.  It will work with industry to protect critical infrastructure and maintain our way of life.  And it will advance the cause of Internet freedom. More information will be available later this afternoon, but the executive order is the first step in the President taking to address the new security challenges of the 21st century. The Vice President today participated in the Republican Policy lunch today in the Senate.  He'll hold several meetings with members on Capitol Hill, the beginning of extensive outreach by our Legislative Affairs team on the President’s Supreme Court choice. Tonight, the Vice President will swear in Elaine Chao, as I mentioned.  We'll have further updates.  We expect it to be at 5 o'clock in the ceremonial office across the way, in the Old Executive Office Building. Secretary Chao is one of the most successful Cabinet officials in American history, having been the longest tenured Secretary of Labor since WWII, and also serving as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation under George H.W. Bush’s administration.  She's the perfect choice to lead the Department of Transportation into what promises to be a significant period of modernization and improvement. As I already mentioned, the last thing on our schedule for tonight is the President's announcement of the next Associate Justice for the Supreme Court.  Tomorrow is the kick-off for Black History Month, and the White House is excited to host a series of events this month in recognition of it.  In particular, the U.S. Post Office will hold a ceremony tomorrow celebrating the official issuance of the Dorothy Height Forever stamp.  Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and is a true pioneer in the Civil Rights Movement. Finally, a couple administrative notes.  On Friday, the President will depart from this White House to the ""Winter White House” down at Mar-A-Lago, where he’ll spend the weekend and be holding meetings.  Further guidance on both trips will be coming out throughout the week. And I’m excited to announce that following up on our announcement of expanding the press briefing room to Skype seats, we’ll officially be launching the briefing room tomorrow.  The inaugural panelists will be Natalie Herbick, from Fox 8 in Cleveland, Ohio; Lars Larson of the Lars Larson Show; Jeff Jobe, from Jobe Publishing in South Central Kentucky; and Kimberly Kalunian, from WPRI in Rhode Island.  Not sure how she snuck in there.  (Laughter.)  I look forward to virtually welcoming them to the briefing room.  And with that, some questions.  John Roberts. Q    The removal last night of Ms. Yates from her position has raised questions as to how this President will deal with dissent in the ranks currently and in the future.  Does he see what she said yesterday as a difference of opinion, an active insubordination?  How would he read it?  And how will he act on similar things in the future? MR. SPICER:  Well, there’s a big difference, John, between listening and sharing ideas, and executing lawful orders.  It is the right of every American to express their idea and opinion, and, frankly, that’s what you’ve seen the President do today.  We’re talking about leaving -- at 2 o'clock hour, him sitting down with cyber experts to get their opinions and ideas on how to protect our critical infrastructures. But there’s a difference.  When she, as the Acting Attorney General, is not only responsible but required to execute lawful orders and defiantly says ""no,"" as someone who was chosen to lead a department, she was rightfully removed.  That is a position of leadership that is given to somebody who is supposed to execute orders that are handed down to them properly, of which that executive order was 100 percent done. Ironically, it went through their office’s -- the Department of Justice Office of Legal Compliance.  So the idea that it went through the entire process of which they were part of, and then she chooses not to execute it, actually is bewildering as well as defiant. Q    So is the President -- so, sorry, can I just follow up on that?  So is the President laying down a marker now to all of his Cabinet secretaries and all of his other officials to say, if I give you a directive and you do not follow it, you’re gone? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think that that kind of comes with the job, right?  If you don’t believe in the President’s agenda -- and I think every one of the Cabinet members, every one of the appointees understands that they serve at the pleasure of the President.  We talked about this at length during the transition.  This isn’t about joining the government to execute your ideas or your initiatives.  The President was very clear during the campaign, whether it was economic security or national security, that he has an agenda that he articulated very, very clearly to the American people, and that -- Q    But -- MR. SPICER:  Hold on.  Thank you.  And that it is his job to lay that vision out, and that the people that he appoints and nominates and announces as staff members or Cabinet-level members or agency heads, their job is to fulfill that.  And if they don’t like it, then they shouldn’t take the job.  But it is the President’s agenda that we are fulfilling here. Trey. Q    Thanks, Sean.  As it relates to the executive order today, how will the Trump administration ensure the digital privacy of all Americans as the President looks to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity? MR. SPICER:  Well, look, just to be clear on the executive order, I think one of the things that the President -- the reason the President wants Mayor Giuliani and some of these cyber experts to come in is to get their ideas, to make sure that where we’re headed in cybersecurity is fulfilling the intent that ensures that our critical infrastructures throughout the government and, frankly, throughout business -- to the extent that the government can be helpful in that -- are protected and secured. So I just want to caution what we may or may not do today.  I think the President has got a pretty good idea of where he’s going to go, but I think he wants to hear what Mayor Giuliani and some of these other experts have to say about the steps that we can take in terms of executive action that will help secure further these critical infrastructures. April. Q    Sean, I have a couple of questions.  I want to go back to the issue of this travel ban. MR. SPICER:  Well, first of all, it’s not a travel ban.  I think you heard Secretary Kelly -- I apologize, I just want to make sure I get this straight.  I think Secretary Kelly or one of the other individuals that got up there from DHS mentioned I think a million people have now come into this country.  That’s not a ban. What it is, is to make sure that the people who are coming in are vetted properly from seven countries that were identified by the Obama administration.  A ban would mean people can’t get in.  We’ve clearly seen hundreds of thousands of people come into our country from other countries.  Sorry.  Go ahead. Q    Okay.  But mind you, I have two questions.  (Laughter.)  MR. SPICER:  I know, of course. Q    So with all of this happening, and as you’re trying to give specifics about what’s happening, what is the concern about the fallout from other countries who are viewing this still in a certain way?  Have you looked at the fallout and how to counter it, and how to work with these other countries that may be allies, or even may not be allies, in order to prevent something from happening? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think, April, one of the things that we’re doing is trying to make sure that people understand what actually happened.  I saw reporting today that Secretary Kelly was out of the loop and he was on a plane and flying, and then it was reported on one of the networks and major institutions about what happened.  And Secretary Kelly comes out and says, I was briefed on this time, I was talked on this time, the edits came from my staff.  I don’t know how -- I don’t want to spend each of these briefings talking about misinformation, but at the end of the day, a major newspaper and a major network reported today that they were kept out of the loop.  The Secretary detailed multiple occasions in which he was briefed on it.  His staff made edits to it. I don’t know how much more -- and so I think part of what we’re trying to do is make sure that people actually understand what happened, what the process was, and what the order actually does.  Because when we use words like “travel ban,” that misrepresents what it is.  It’s seven countries previously identified by the Obama administration where, frankly, we don’t get the information that we need for people coming into this country. Because what this isn’t about is not just the people.  It’s about the information that another country provides us.  So we work with other countries, and we have systems in place to ensure that when you travel from our country to their -- or from their country to our country or vice versa, that we are sharing information about passengers and citizens that are going in and out.  These seven countries in particular, we don’t have the information that is necessarily required to make an accurate determination at the time of entry into our country.  So we are going to make sure that because that country doesn’t have maybe either the systems in place or, in some cases, the willingness to provide us the information necessary to ensure that the people that are coming into this country are properly vetted. This isn’t about refugees, it’s about travelers.  And that’s what this is about. And so part of what we’re doing is, frankly, making sure that other countries understand exactly what was in the order, how it, how it applies, what it means to visas and waivers and all this kind of stuff.  But for the most part, you've seen a lot of panic, and the people actually stopping, reading the order, and realizing, ""oh, that's it?""  And I think that's what we've tried to make sure that people have the facts.  Q    So you're doing outreach for that? MR. SPICER:  We're doing -- we're not just doing outreach.  I think we're doing as many briefings -- Secretary Kelly going out there a little while ago with the head of both ICE and CBP is trying to make sure that people understand that the process is working correctly -- it’s working very well -- that the government is doing what it’s supposed to, to protect its people.  And that's the number one thing that we can do. Yeah. Q    One other -- you said, two. MR. SPICER:  I’m sorry.  You're right. Q    Now, the President met with the pharmaceutical heads. MR. SPICER:  Yeah. Q    When is this meeting scheduled for Congressman Elijah Cummings and President Trump, after that call that President Trump made -- MR. SPICER:  Right.  My understanding is that Congressman Cummings was -- he was invited to this meeting.  He had a scheduling conflict, and we're looking at setting it back up.  But he was invited to the meeting today.  He informed us he had a scheduling conflict.  And we're looking to get it back on the books as soon as we can. Q    Would it be one on one?  Not -- MR. SPICER:  I expect at this point it will be one on one. Q    Thanks, a lot, Sean.  Does the President anticipate a difficult confirmation fight for his nominee, whoever that is? MR. SPICER:  No.  I think we've proven so far that the Democrats can try to obstruct, but at the end of the day, the will of the American people is going to overcome that. And again, what I mentioned at the outset of this is the advice and consent piece of this.  He and our team have met with senators from both sides of the aisle to make sure that we understand the qualities that they are looking for in the next associate justice.  And I think that we have done a very, very good job of getting a nominee in place that will be announced tonight that meets the criteria that they set forth.  They may not like their political or philosophical background, but I think the criteria in terms of academia background, time on the bench, the expertise and criteria meets the intent of both Republicans and Democrats. John Gizzi. Q    Do you believe you can get nine Democrats to support this nominee? MR. SPICER:  I do.  Absolutely.  Because I think at the end of the day, one of the things that's been a time-honored tradition in this country is that we recognize that the confirmation process is -- the default is that if you're qualified for the position, then you should be confirmed.  Not the other around. And I think that most Democrats realize that at some point that is -- having a court that is not fully operational is not the political fight to have. John Gizzi. Q    Sean, let me ask you the obvious follow-up question then.  At least one Republican senator has said Democrats have removed the filibuster from just about every other appointment, aside from the Supreme Court.  And he said several Republicans say they would have no hesitation about moving for another nuclear option if Democrats attempt a filibuster of any of the possible nominees.  Is this something the President would support?  And has he discussed it with members of the Senate? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think first and foremost taking a step to the last question, I think we're going to get the nine senators regardless, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we get more.  When you look -- and I’ll be able to shed more light on this tomorrow in terms of the background.  But I think that he is -- we've got an individual that I think is hopefully going to garner widespread bipartisan support because I think this individual has the qualifications and the experience and the judicial philosophy that should win bipartisan support.  That being said, beyond that, I would suggest that that's -- Senator McConnell has done a phenomenal job of moving things along in the Senate to the extent that Democrats will let him.  And I'll leave any further questions on how the Senate operates to him. Blake. Q    Sean, thanks.  We know that the list of 21 was put out during the campaign.  We know that, at 8:02 tonight, the President is going to reveal his selection.  Can you kind of fill the gap in between as to how often the President might have spoken with this person, whether there were any meetings here at the White House, just any of the -- how he got there?  And then the last hours -- (laughter) -- or in the last days here, really, who has he leaned on to kind of narrow this down?  And then a follow-up, if you don’t mind. MR. SPICER:  I will say, I think I can probably shed a lot more light on this tomorrow.  I appreciate the effort to try to head that off.  Tomorrow I think we might be able to have a little bit more of a discussion as to how the President came to this choice.  He may touch on it a little tonight; I'll leave it to him.  But I appreciate that. Q    Let me ask you about the news of the day.  Prescription drug prices -- the President met with the pharma leaders earlier today.  What makes him so confident that he can drive down drug prices, whereas administrations past have tried to do the same but haven't been able to?  How is he going to go about it? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think it's the story of his entire administration.  He's a successful businessman and a top-notch negotiator.  Several people tried to get the cost of planes down, the cost of the F-35 and the cost of the Air Force One.  And through a couple of conversations, he did it -- shaved billions off of the cost of both -- excuse me, off the F-35 and significant off the next generation of Air Force One. I think he has a track record so far just during the transition, but also as a businessman -- he knows how to negotiate.  And I think he is going to sit down with these individuals the same way that he's getting people to understand the agenda and the regulatory and tax climate that he wants to institute that's bringing jobs home.  People are making a commitment to him to bring jobs and manufacturing back based on his track record as a businessman and his word.  They understand that he's going to create a climate that supports the American worker and American manufacturing.  So I think -- you look over and over again, the number of companies that want to come back and say, we want to be part of this agenda to grow the economy and to create jobs or to help you fight on behalf of taxpayers, and I think you're going to continue to see that. He understands the challenges that the bureaucracy that's holding back some of the negotiating, that's allowing these prescription drug prices to drop or get the best deal for the government in cases whether it's Medicare or Medicaid, who are such large buyers of the VA -- that you're not -- you have got such purchasing power that's not being utilized to the full extent. Hunter Walker. Q    Thank you, Sean.  The President is meeting with Mayor Giuliani today.  What do you think of the mayor's claim that the executive order on those seven countries evolved from the Muslim ban that the President proposed during the campaign?  Is that accurate? MR. SPICER:  I think the President has talked about extreme vetting and the need to keep America safe for a very, very long time.  At the same time, he's also made very clear that this is not a Muslim ban.  It's not a travel ban.  It's a vetting system to keep America safe -- that's it, plain and simple.  And all of the facts and a reading of it clearly show that that's what it is. Q    Mayor Giuliani stressed that too, but he said that it came out of the desire to have a Muslim ban. MR. SPICER:  Then you should ask Mayor Giuliani.  That's his opinion.  I'm just telling you what the President has said and what the President has done has been to focus on making sure that we keep the country safe and that the executive order that was drafted does just that -- is to make sure and to ensure that people coming in from seven countries, identified by the Obama administration, that we didn't have the proper systems to know who was coming into our country was put in place, and a 90-day period was also granted to ensure that we knew how to further address vetting situations in the future. Zeke. Q    Thanks, Sean.  Just following up again about the strike over the weekend in Yemen.  Can you confirm that the eight-year-old -- the reports that the eight-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in that strike?  And if you can address sort of the killing of the American citizen in this anti-terrorism operation. MR. SPICER:  I'm not going to go any further than what the Department of Defense has released.  Obviously, we recovered a tremendous amount of information, and we killed an estimated 14 members of al Qaeda in -- AQAP individuals.  And then we suffered the loss of life of a servicemember, and four people were injured.  That's as far as I'm willing to go at this time. Kristen. Q    Sean, thanks.  You're saying it's not a ban.  This was President Trump's tweet yesterday:  ""If the ban were announced with a one-week notice, the 'bad' would rush into our country during that week.""  So he says it's a ban.  MR. SPICER:  He's using the words that the media is using.  But at the end of the day, it can't -- Q    Those are his words. Q    Wait a minute. MR. SPICER:  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  It can't be -- Q    That's his words, his tweet. MR. SPICER:  Jonathan, thanks, I'll let Kristen talk.  It can't be a ban if you're letting a million people in.  If 325,000 people from another country can't come in, that is by nature not a ban -- it is extreme vetting. Q    I understand your point.  But the President himself called it a ban. MR. SPICER:  I understand that. Q    Is he confused or are you confused? MR. SPICER:  No, I'm not confused.  I think that the words that are being used to describe it are derived from what the media is calling this.  He has been very clear that it is extreme vetting. Q    It seems to fit into this broader point, Sean, which Paul Ryan said today:  ""I think it's regrettable that there was some confusion on the rollout of this.""  The House Speaker saying that.  What do you say to Republicans who argue that this is a part of a broader issue with the President not enacting this policy smoothly? MR. SPICER:  Well, first of all, I think we've addressed that -- that we could have either telegraphed this days in advance, in which people could have gotten on planes and come over here, which would have undermined the exact nature of what this sought to prevent.  Or we could have done it in a way that inconvenienced some folks for a little while -- Q    But do you dispute that there was confusion -- MR. SPICER:  Can I answer the -- no, no, I do -- there’s clearly some confusion.  But I think part of it, your network was one of the people that just hours ago told people that General Kelly was unaware of what’s going on.  And then moments later he gets on air saying, here’s how many times I got briefed.  So, I mean, with all due respect, I think you have been part of the confusion.  You have helped cause this, despite claims that whatever.  You claim that you have sources that tell us.  General Kelly stands up and says, this is how many times I’ve been briefed, this is how many people were involved.  And yet you were out there for -- Q    I think there was a New York Times report that was cited -- MR. SPICER:  Oh, okay, so I apologize if NBC News’s reporting is based on The New York Times’s false reporting.  Q    It was accurate reporting, Sean. MR. SPICER:  How can it be accurate reporting, Glenn, if -- Q    Both things can be true. Q    It was accurate reporting, Sean. MR. SPICER:  Okay, so the -- Q    They can be true that he -- MR. SPICER:  The Secretary of Homeland Security just stood up, and so you're calling him a liar? Q    He didn't say he saw the specifics of the --  MR. SPICER:  Jonathan, I’m talking to Glenn.  I’m talking to Glenn. Q    No one is calling anyone a liar.  I’m saying we -- MR. SPICER:  You said that the report in the New York Times said that he was unaware of the ban.  Q    Sean, let me ask you a question.  MR. SPICER:  Hold on.  No, no, answer the question.  Because you just called this -- Q    So a couple of minutes ago you stood at the podium and you reiterated something you said yesterday about anyone who doesn't agree in terms of career bureaucracy should hit the road.  I’m paraphrasing.  You had a statement that President Trump made where he accused the acting Attorney General of “betraying” her own department by expressing a counter opinion.  Don't you think that kind of language has a chilling effect on the public statements that your officials make? MR. SPICER:  No, I think there’s a big difference.  Think about the process that worked it here.  The Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Compliance vetted the executive order, sent it back to us saying it was completely compliant.  Then the acting Attorney General goes out and says, I’m not going to enforce it.  You tell me how that jives.  Because at the end of the day, if the action Attorney General has an office under her jurisdiction that says that something is legal and compliant, and then she gets out there and says, I’m not going to enforce it, that doesn't sound like an Attorney General that is upholding the duty that she swore to uphold. Q    Well, if she think it's illegal -- MR. SPICER:  At the end of the day -- then she should step down.  But at the end of the day, the Attorney General either had a problem with her own division approving something.  But it wasn’t the President she had a problem with.  The President followed the process, sought feedback, went through the inter-agency review, had other departments sign off, despite the reporting that said it was otherwise.  Q    But is this a betrayal, though?  MR. SPICER:  Hold on.  Guys -- Q    Is it a betrayal?  MR. SPICER:  David. Q    That's a very hard word.  MR. SPICER:  Why don't we just let me answer Glenn so we can be polite now, huh?  And what the answer is, is that we went through the process.  The Office of Legal Compliance came back and said, this is a compliant executive order, it’s fully legal, and it can be executed. So then for the Attorney General to turn around and say, I’m not going to uphold this lawful executive order is clearly a dereliction of duty.  And she should have been removed, and she was.  I just -- it is odd to me that we're having a discussion about somebody whose job it is to execute lawful orders who chose not to do it -- hold on -- who chose not to do it, and then we're questioning whether or not we were right to remove her.  That's the right thing to do. And if you looked at the folks from the right and the left, constitutional scholars this morning -- they said, we might not agree with some of the policies or the political -- or the party of the President, but he was right to do this.  He had every right -- Q    So why use the word “betrayal” -- MR. SPICER:  Because the department’s job is to execute.  They're the Department of Justice.  And if you have a legally executed order and the Attorney General says, I’m not going to execute it, that truly -- that clearly is a betrayal of what she’s -- Q    Let’s define the word ""betrayal."" MR. SPICER:  I’m not going to define the word, Glenn. Yes. Q    Sean, I think the New York Times report said that the Secretary did not receive a full briefing until the executive order was being signed.  So my question is, can we expect that secretaries, agency heads, when there are future executive orders or changes of policy, may not receive full briefings before -- MR. SPICER:  Look, the Secretary was briefed on multiple occasions with the language of the order.  I don't know how you can say this any other way. Q    Well, I'm just talking about a full briefing, which is what the New York Times reported. MR. SPICER:  And I’m telling you that I don't believe the New York Times reporting is accurate.  What I’m telling you is that the Secretary on multiple occasions was briefed, his senior officials were briefed -- not just briefed; they were part of the drafting process.  It went through -- not only that.  Just back up.  So they get consulted and briefed.  It goes through the Office of Legal Compliance.  Then it gets shipped out to the NSC and the Homeland Security Council.  This went through a very, very extensive staffing process.  So the idea that you can talk whether or not he got fully briefed or -- he was briefed multiple times, saw the language.  His staff made edits.  It came back multiple times.  I’m not sure how much more briefing you can do.  Q    Thank you, Sean.  Zoe Daniel, from Australian Broadcasting.  Thanks for taking the question.  The Australian government made a recent deal with the Obama administration whereby the U.S. would take refugees from Australia’s offshore detention centers.  Now most of these people are from Iran, but also some are from Iraq and Somalia, among other places.  Can you confirm that this deal is still on?  Are those refugees exempt from what you describe as the extreme vetting?  Or will that deal change or be delayed? MR. SPICER:  So the deal specifically deals with 1,250 people.  They're mostly in Papua New Guinea, being held.  Those people -- part of the deal is that they have to be vetted in the same manner that we're doing now.  There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them.  That is part and parcel of the deal that was made.  And it was made by the Obama administration with the full backing of the United States government.  The President, in accordance with that deal to honor what had been agreed upon by the United States government, and in ensuring that that vetting will take place in the same manner that we're doing it now, will go forward. Yes. Q    The big question -- looking at the bigger picture -- this President, when he came in, said he was going to gather us all together, that he was going to bring us together.  And the actions taken in the first 10 days seem to indicate otherwise from people in his own party -- the use of the word “betrayal.” How is this President going to address the fact that people are looking to him to bring people together, and yet with his own words seems to be driving us apart? MR. SPICER:  I think that's a very one-sided way of looking at this.  I think he’s brought -- Q    Elaborate. MR. SPICER:  I will.  I think he’s brought unions together, business leaders together, Republicans, Democrats, independents.  I think someone who doesn't carry out an act and using that as a way to describe that he’s not bringing the country together is not exactly a representation.  Q    I have one quick follow-up. MR. SPICER:  Hold on.  I don't -- I’m not -- the President has done a tremendous amount through both what he has said and done, more importantly, to start to bring this country together.  And his policies, frankly, are focused on keeping every American safe and getting every American a higher-paying and better-paying job.  I think that is something that benefits all of us. Q    The follow-up -- I asked you about a shield law for journalists last week.  You said you would get with this? Q    If I could just -- MR. SPICER:  Hold on. Q    -- ask real quick on trade.  Now that notices have been given to the TPP countries, are you considering any changes in the roles of your three sort of official trade negotiators?  And what area of the globe are you going to start first on negotiations? MR. SPICER:  Well, there's no change in their roles.  I'm not entirely sure. I think they -- as announced -- Q    (Inaudible) negotiator -- MR. SPICER:  He is the U.S. -- I mean, he's got to be confirmed first, but the U.S. trade representative is clearly the leader of negotiating trade deals.  Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro and Jason Greenblatt -- there's a great, unbelievably robust, brilliant team that has continued to work on behalf of deals and renegotiating, looking at them.  So it's a two-step process. I think, number one, we're going to reexamine all of the current trade deals, figure out if we can re-improve them.  But secondly, I think we're going to start talking to other countries around the globe, including some of those TPP partners.  I think of the 11 other countries, five of them we have current trade deals with.  So you would examine those to see if we can improve upon them and then look at the other countries in there and see if there's a willingness to engage with some of those other countries. Q    Sean, the President has previously indicated that he would encourage the targeting of families of terror suspects.  Is that still his current position? MR. SPICER:  When did he say that? Q    December 3rd, on Fox.  He said, ""The other thing with [the] terrorists is you have to take out their families.""  Is that still his position? MR. SPICER:  I think he's been very clear that when it comes to seeking out ISIS and other terrorists, that he's going to lean on Director Pompeo, General Mattis, and seek their opinion on stuff.  And I think that will be continued. Sarah. Q    Even the families of terror suspects, civilian members of families, Sean? MR. SPICER:  Thank you.  Rebecca. Q    On Guantanamo, Sean.  Thanks for taking this question.  I know that you've indicated at that podium that there will be further action.  What does this look like?  And there are five detainees that have been cleared for transfer that are sitting at Guantanamo.  Would this administration take action in the next coming months on those detainees? MR. SPICER:  I think all of those actions are being currently reviewed, and we don't have anything further at this time. Q    The Obama administration's endangerment finding undergirds the Clean Power Plan.  Does the President still plan to revoke the Clean Power Plan?  And would he perhaps even go further and try and revoke the endangerment finding? MR. SPICER:  Well, I think the President has made very clear with respect to energy policy that he wants to review all of the options that we have to use our natural resources to better the country in terms of wind power, solar, clean coal.  We're in the process of reviewing all of our energy policies.  I'd go back to note that we don't have an Energy Secretary confirmed right now because the Senate hasn't yet moved forward with that.  I hope that once that's done, we will have further updates on energy. Matt. Q    Sean, Sally Yates was obviously an Obama appointee, was holding it through the transition.  How many more of them are there throughout the government at this time, as the transition and confirmation process plays out?  And do you expect any more problems from any of the other ones? MR. SPICER:  In some cases, we’ve held some individuals over because they hold a critical position within government.  In some cases, we’ve named folks as acting.  It’s a case-by-case basis.  And again, I think part of it right now is the President wanted to focus on getting his Cabinet up and complete.  We’ll continue to make nominations both at the deputy, under and assistant secretary-level.  But in key agencies -- so, ICE being one of them, where it’s an assistant secretary.  But there are 30 other agencies where we’ve named acting heads to ensure that as we move through the confirmation process, we have somebody in that position to ensure continuity of government.  Daniel. Q    Sean, yesterday you said 109 individuals were affected by this extreme vetting. MR. SPICER:  Right. Q    DHS officials said that it was over 1,100. MR. SPICER:  No, no, no, hold on.  First of all, just to be clear, what they’re talking about is the number of people who weren’t allowed to board a plane coming in.  So they were stopped at their port of entry, had to get additional clearance, and then take off.  There’s a big difference.  The numbers that we’re talking about were the initial group of people that were in transit at the time the executive order was signed. And then there’s another group of people -- and the Department of Homeland Security has those numbers up to date on their website -- where they’re talking about people that are stopped at the port of entry to ensure that they’re properly vetted before they board a plane.  There’s a very, very delicate distinction between people who were on the plane coming into this country when the executive order was signed, all of who have been vetted and cleared, and the people who have been stopped at a port of entry in one of those seven countries to ensure that the proper vetting took place before they were able to move on. Q    Sean, Hallie’s question was about civilians that are being targeted by the administration in anti-terror raids.  And Zeke’s question was about al-Awlaki’s daughter.  So let me ask you:  Is the President willing to kill and target American citizens, even minors, just because their family members are terrorists? MR. SPICER:  No American citizen will ever be targeted. Q    One more follow-up there.  If you’re qualified for the position -- you said earlier, if you’re qualified for the position, you should get confirmed.  That’s not how Merrick Garland was treated in the previous administration. MR. SPICER:  No, there’s never been a situation in which you had a fourth-term -- someone that late in an election cycle.  That had never occurred before.  And I think that the Senate Republicans were very clear that we should wait and let the voters have a choice, and that’s exactly what happened.  As I noted at the beginning of this, 70 percent of people thought that the President’s choice for the next Supreme Court was a major decision.  That was something he campaigned on.  I think when you’re that late in a term -- it had never happened before.  And the goal was to make sure that the voters had a say in allowing that to happen.  And I think that, clearly, it worked.  The voters looked at that as a major reason in which they voted for the President.  And I think that as we move forward, that’s why I think we’re going to get the support we need. Q    Sean, if the President does get his pick on the bench, what are any specific cases that the administration hopes that the Court takes up in the near future MR. SPICER:  Well, there’s a lot of cases that I think are in the queue right now that have the potential to be 4-4.  I think the idea is to get this individual confirmed as soon as possible just to get the docket moving.  That’s probably the biggest priority right now. Thank you guys very much.  Have a great day.  I’ll see you tonight.  Good luck.  Eight o'clock.  END - 1:50 P.M.

Edith Kermit Carow knew Theodore Roosevelt from infancy; as a toddler she became a playmate of his younger sister Corinne. Born in Connecticut in 1861, daughter of Charles and Gertrude Tyler Carow, she grew up in an old New York brownstone on Union Square -- an environment of comfort and tradition. Throughout childhood she and ""Teedie"" were in and out of each other's houses. Attending Miss Comstock's school, she acquired the proper finishing touch for a young lady of that era. A quiet girl who loved books, she was often Theodore's companion for summer outings at Oyster Bay, Long Island; but this ended when he entered Harvard. Although she attended his wedding to Alice Hathaway Lee in 1880, their lives ran separately until 1885, when he was a young widower with an infant daughter, Alice. Putting tragedy behind him, he and Edith were married in London in December 1886. They settled down in a house on Sagamore Hill, at Oyster Bay, headquarters for a family that added five children in ten years: Theodore, Kermit, Ethel, Archibald, and Quentin. Throughout Roosevelt's intensely active career, family life remained close and entirely delightful. A small son remarked one day, ""When Mother was a little girl, she must have been a boy!"" Public tragedy brought them into the White House, eleven days after President McKinley succumbed to an assassin's bullet. Assuming her new duties with characteristic dignity, Mrs. Roosevelt meant to guard the privacy of a family that attracted everyone's interest, and she tried to keep reporters outside her domain. The public, in consequence, heard little of the vigor of her character, her sound judgment, her efficient household management. But in this administration the White House was unmistakably the social center of the land. Beyond the formal occasions, smaller parties brought together distinguished men and women from varied walks of life. Two family events were highlights: the wedding of ""Princess Alice"" to Nicholas Longworth, and Ethel's debut. A perceptive aide described the First Lady as ""always the gentle, high-bred hostess; smiling often at what went on about her, yet never critical of the ignorant and tolerant always of the little insincerities of political life."" T.R. once wrote to Ted Jr. that ""if Mother had been a mere unhealthy Patient Griselda I might have grown set in selfish and inconsiderate ways."" She continued, with keen humor and unfailing dignity, to balance her husband's exuberance after they retired in 1909. After his death in 1919, she traveled abroad but always returned to Sagamore Hill as her home. Alone much of the time, she never appeared lonely, being still an avid reader -- ""not only cultured but scholarly,"" as T.R. had said. She kept till the end her interest in the Needlework Guild, a charity which provided garments for the poor, and in the work of Christ Church at Oyster Bay. She died on September 30, 1948, at the age of 87. The biographies of the First Ladies on WhiteHouse.gov are from “The First Ladies of the United States of America,” by Allida Black.

""I detest him so much that I don't even think his wife is beautiful."" So spoke one of President Grover Cleveland's political foes--the only person, it seems, to deny the loveliness of this notable First Lady, first bride of a President to be married in the White House. She was born in Buffalo, New York, only child of Emma C. Harmon and Oscar Folsom--who became a law partner of Cleveland's. As a devoted family friend Cleveland bought ""Frank"" her first baby carriage. As administrator of the Folsom estate after his partner's death, though never her legal guardian, he guided her education with sound advice. When she entered Wells College, he asked Mrs. Folsom's permission to correspond with her, and he kept her room bright with flowers. Though Frank and her mother missed his inauguration in 1885, they visited him at the White House that spring. There affection turned into romance--despite 27 years' difference in age--and there the wedding took place on June 2, 1886. Cleveland's scholarly sister Rose Elizabeth Cleveland: her bachelor brother's hostess in 15 months of his first term of office. Rose gladly gave up the duties of hostess for her own career in education; and with a bride as First Lady, state entertainments took on a new interest. Mrs. Cleveland's unaffected charm won her immediate popularity. She held two receptions a week--one on Saturday afternoons, when women with jobs were free to come. After the President's defeat in 1888, the Clevelands lived in New York City, where baby Ruth was born. With his unprecedented re-election, the First Lady returned to the White House as if she had been gone but a day. Through the political storms of this term she always kept her place in public favor. People took keen interest in the birth of Esther at the mansion in 1893, and of Marion in 1895. When the family left the White House, Mrs. Cleveland had become one of the most popular women ever to serve as hostess for the nation. She bore two sons while the Clevelands lived in Princeton, New Jersey, and was at her husband's side when he died at their home, ""Westland,"" in 1908. In 1913 she married Thomas J. Preston, Jr., a professor of archeology, and remained a figure of note in the Princeton community until she died. She had reached her 84th year-nearly the age at which the venerable Mrs. Polk had welcomed her and her husband on a Presidential visit to the South, and chatted of changes in White House life from bygone days.

Transcript: My fellow Americans, This week our hearts are with the people of Louisiana and Mississippi. Families have lost their homes, businesses, and livelihoods after devastating tornadoes swept through many, many communities.  My administration will make sure they have the support that they need and really desperately want. We’re going to take care of them. It’s remarkable to see Americans across the country come together to help families rebuild their lives. That is the beauty of the American spirit – there’s nothing like it. There is a great spirit all over the country – and that spirit is what we will need to rebuild America to, as I have said so often, Make America Great Again. On Tuesday, I was pleased to host at the White House the CEO of Intel, who announced that Intel will invest $7 billion dollars in a new manufacturing facility in Arizona – creating thousands of new American jobs. That’s what we want, new American jobs, and good jobs. Intel decided to move forward with this project because they know we are totally committed to lifting the regulatory and tax burdens that are hurting American innovation and companies. In fact, we are in the process right now of working on a major tax reform that will massively reduce taxes on our workers and businesses.  We want to make it much easier to do business in America – and that’s what we are going to do. We are going to make it also much harder for companies to leave.  They’re not just going to say bye-bye and fire everybody. There will be consequences. I want America to be the great jobs magnet of the world – but we can’t do that if we don’t stop the wasteful rules and excessive taxes that make it impossible for companies to compete.  Every hour of every day, my Administration is focused on creating jobs for our people and I mean good jobs. More jobs, better jobs, higher-paying jobs – that’s our mission. This week, I also met with Sheriffs and Police Chiefs from across the country.  I pledged to them that we would stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement – and so too will our great new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. My administration is committed to your security, which is why we will continue to fight to take all necessary and legal action to keep terrorists, radical and dangerous extremists from ever entering our country.  We will not allow our generous system of immigration to be turned against us as a tool for terrorism and truly bad people. We must take firm steps today to ensure that we are safe tomorrow. We will defend our country, protect our Constitution, and deliver real prosperity for our people. God bless you, God bless America. Have a great week.

Arthur. She tragically died of pneumonia before he took office. Chester Alan Arthur's beloved ""Nell"" died of pneumonia on January 12, 1880. That November, when he was elected Vice President, he was still mourning her bitterly. In his own words: ""Honors to me now are not what they once were."" His grief was the more poignant because she was only 42 and her death sudden. Just two days earlier she had attended a benefit concert in New York City--while he was busy with politics in Albany--and she caught cold that night while waiting for her carriage. She was already unconscious when he reached her side. Her family connections among distinguished Virginians had shaped her life. She was born at Culpeper Court House, only child of Elizabeth Hansbrough and William Lewis Herndon, U.S.N. They moved to Washington, D.C., when he was assigned to help his brother-in-law Lt. Matthew Fontaine Maury establish the Naval Observatory. While Ellen was still just a girl her beautiful contralto voice attracted attention; she joined the choir at St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square. Then her father assumed command of a mail steamer operating from New York; and in 1856 a cousin introduced her to ""Chet"" Arthur, who was establishing a law practice in the city. By 1857 they were engaged. In a birthday letter that year he reminded her of ""the soft, moonlight nights of June, a year ago...happy, happy days at Saratoga--the golden, fleeting hours at Lake George."" He wished he could hear her singing. That same year her father died a hero's death at sea, going down with his ship in a gale off Cape Hatteras. The marriage did not take place until October 1859; and a son named for Commander Herndon died when only two. But another boy was born in 1864 and a girl, named for her mother, in 1871. Arthur's career brought the family an increasing prosperity; they decorated their home in the latest fashion and entertained prominent friends with elegance. At Christmas there were jewels from Tiffany for Nell, the finest toys for the children. At the White House, Arthur would not give anyone the place that would have been his wife's. He asked his sister Mary (Mrs. John E. McElroy) to assume certain social duties and help care for his daughter. He presented a stained-glass window to St. John's Church in his wife's memory; it depicted angels of the Resurrection, and at his special request it was placed in the south transept so that he could see it at night from the White House with the lights of the church shining through.

She received the recognition at the annual fundraiser called, “And the Winner is…Tracy’s Kids,” an event supporting a charity that employs art therapy to help young cancer patients cope with the emotional toll imposed by cancer and its treatment.  The Courage Award honors the strength, dignity and perseverance that cancer patients exhibit every day, and is presented to a public person who has worked to address the challenges inflicted by the disease. “I am humbled by the recognition and grateful for the opportunity to be involved with an organization with such an important mission of providing art therapy to children with cancer,” said Mrs. Pence. “Tracy’s Kids is truly making a difference throughout our country and it’s encouraging to know that their art therapy programs are bringing a sense of hope to children and their families battling through a difficult period in their lives. I am honored to receive the Courage Award and will continue to help art therapy programs further their efforts and reach more families in our country and world as the Second Lady of the United States.” Mrs. Pence has served on the board of Tracy’s Kids since 2011 and also serves as the Honorary Chair of the Art Therapy Initiative at Riley Hospital for  Children in Indianapolis, Indiana.  In 2014, through a charitable foundation she founded while serving as the First Lady of Indiana,  Mrs. Pence presented Riley Hospital for Children with a check in the amount of $100,000 to support their art therapy program.  She has also made it a priority to visit hospitals in the U. S. and other parts of the world when she travels abroad in order to get an up close look at art therapists in action as they are helping children. Mrs. Pence acknowledges that what art therapists do for the children and their families is critical to their healing, both emotionally and physically and appreciates the work they do to make a positive difference in their lives. Tracy’s Kids art therapy program is provided at no cost to the children and families they serve at seven separate clinics: Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, Children’s National Medical Center, Children’s Hospital/Physicians Specialists of Virginia, Inova Children’s Hospital, Methodist Children’s Hospital in San Antonio, New York Presbyterian Hospital and Children’s Hospital at Sinai, Baltimore.  Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.

Roosevelt Assuming the Presidency at the depth of the Great Depression as our 32nd President (1933-1945), Franklin D. Roosevelt helped the American people regain faith in themselves. Assuming the Presidency at the depth of the Great Depression, Franklin D. Roosevelt helped the American people regain faith in themselves. He brought hope as he promised prompt, vigorous action, and asserted in his Inaugural Address, ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" Born in 1882 at Hyde Park, New York--now a national historic site--he attended Harvard University and Columbia Law School. On St. Patrick's Day, 1905, he married Eleanor Roosevelt. Following the example of his fifth cousin, President Theodore Roosevelt, whom he greatly admired, Franklin D. Roosevelt entered public service through politics, but as a Democrat. He won election to the New York Senate in 1910. President Wilson appointed him Assistant Secretary of the Navy, and he was the Democratic nominee for Vice President in 1920. In the summer of 1921, when he was 39, disaster hit-he was stricken with poliomyelitis. Demonstrating indomitable courage, he fought to regain the use of his legs, particularly through swimming. At the 1924 Democratic Convention he dramatically appeared on crutches to nominate Alfred E. Smith as ""the Happy Warrior."" In 1928 Roosevelt became Governor of New York. He was elected President in November 1932, to the first of four terms. By March there were 13,000,000 unemployed, and almost every bank was closed. In his first ""hundred days,"" he proposed, and Congress enacted, a sweeping program to bring recovery to business and agriculture, relief to the unemployed and to those in danger of losing farms and homes, and reform, especially through the establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority. By 1935 the Nation had achieved some measure of recovery, but businessmen and bankers were turning more and more against Roosevelt's New Deal program. They feared his experiments, were appalled because he had taken the Nation off the gold standard and allowed deficits in the budget, and disliked the concessions to labor. Roosevelt responded with a new program of reform: Social Security, heavier taxes on the wealthy, new controls over banks and public utilities, and an enormous work relief program for the unemployed. In 1936 he was re-elected by a top-heavy margin. Feeling he was armed with a popular mandate, he sought legislation to enlarge the Supreme Court, which had been invalidating key New Deal measures. Roosevelt lost the Supreme Court battle, but a revolution in constitutional law took place. Thereafter the Government could legally regulate the economy. Roosevelt had pledged the United States to the ""good neighbor"" policy, transforming the Monroe Doctrine from a unilateral American manifesto into arrangements for mutual action against aggressors. He also sought through neutrality legislation to keep the United States out of the war in Europe, yet at the same time to strengthen nations threatened or attacked. When France fell and England came under siege in 1940, he began to send Great Britain all possible aid short of actual military involvement. When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Roosevelt directed organization of the Nation's manpower and resources for global war. Feeling that the future peace of the world would depend upon relations between the United States and Russia, he devoted much thought to the planning of a United Nations, in which, he hoped, international difficulties could be settled. As the war drew to a close, Roosevelt's health deteriorated, and on April 12, 1945, while at Warm Springs, Georgia, he died of a cerebral hemorrhage.  The Presidential biographies on WhiteHouse.gov are from “The Presidents of the United States of America,” by Frank Freidel and Hugh Sidey.

Hayes As the 19th President of the United States (1877-1881), Rutherford B. Hayes oversaw the end of Reconstruction, began the efforts that led to civil service reform, and attempted to reconcile the divisions left over from the Civil War. Beneficiary of the most fiercely disputed election in American history, Rutherford B. Hayes brought to the Executive Mansion dignity, honesty, and moderate reform. To the delight of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Lucy Webb Hayes carried out her husband's orders to banish wines and liquors from the White House. Born in Ohio in 1822, Hayes was educated at Kenyon College and Harvard Law School. After five years of law practice in Lower Sandusky, he moved to Cincinnati, where he flourished as a young Whig lawyer. He fought in the Civil War, was wounded in action, and rose to the rank of brevet major general. While he was still in the Army, Cincinnati Republicans ran him for the House of Representatives. He accepted the nomination, but would not campaign, explaining, ""an officer fit for duty who at this crisis would abandon his post to electioneer... ought to be scalped."" Elected by a heavy majority, Hayes entered Congress in December 1865, troubled by the ""Rebel influences ... ruling the White House."" Between 1867 and 1876 he served three terms as Governor of Ohio. Safe liberalism, party loyalty, and a good war record made Hayes an acceptable Republican candidate in 1876. He opposed Governor Samuel J. Tilden of New York. Although a galaxy of famous Republican speakers, and even Mark Twain, stumped for Hayes, he expected the Democrats to win. When the first returns seemed to confirm this, Hayes went to bed, believing he had lost. But in New York, Republican National Chairman Zachariah Chandler, aware of a loophole, wired leaders to stand firm: ""Hayes has 185 votes and is elected."" The popular vote apparently was 4,300,000 for Tilden to 4,036,000 for Hayes. Hayes's election depended upon contested electoral votes in Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida. If all the disputed electoral votes went to Hayes, he would win; a single one would elect Tilden. Months of uncertainty followed. In January 1877 Congress established an Electoral Commission to decide the dispute. The commission, made up of eight Republicans and seven Democrats, determined all the contests in favor of Hayes by eight to seven. The final electoral vote: 185 to 184. Northern Republicans had been promising southern Democrats at least one Cabinet post, Federal patronage, subsidies for internal improvements, and withdrawal of troops from Louisiana and South Carolina. Hayes insisted that his appointments must be made on merit, not political considerations. For his Cabinet he chose men of high caliber, but outraged many Republicans because one member was an ex-Confederate and another had bolted the party as a Liberal Republican in 1872. Hayes pledged protection of the rights of Negroes in the South, but at the same time advocated the restoration of ""wise, honest, and peaceful local self-government."" This meant the withdrawal of troops. Hayes hoped such conciliatory policies would lead to the building of a ""new Republican party"" in the South, to which white businessmen and conservatives would rally. Many of the leaders of the new South did indeed favor Republican economic policies and approved of Hayes's financial conservatism, but they faced annihilation at the polls if they were to join the party of Reconstruction. Hayes and his Republican successors were persistent in their efforts but could not win over the ""solid South."" Hayes had announced in advance that he would serve only one term, and retired to Spiegel Grove, his home in Fremont, Ohio, in 1881. He died in 1893.

More nearly than any of his predecessors, Andrew Jackson was elected by popular vote; as President he sought to act as the direct representative of the common man. Born in a backwoods settlement in the Carolinas in 1767, he received sporadic education. But in his late teens he read law for about two years, and he became an outstanding young lawyer in Tennessee. Fiercely jealous of his honor, he engaged in brawls, and in a duel killed a man who cast an unjustified slur on his wife Rachel. Jackson prospered sufficiently to buy slaves and to build a mansion, the Hermitage, near Nashville. He was the first man elected from Tennessee to the House of Representatives, and he served briefly in the Senate. A major general in the War of 1812, Jackson became a national hero when he defeated the British at New Orleans. In 1824 some state political factions rallied around Jackson; by 1828 enough had joined ""Old Hickory"" to win numerous state elections and control of the Federal administration in Washington. In his first Annual Message to Congress, Jackson recommended eliminating the Electoral College. He also tried to democratize Federal officeholding. Already state machines were being built on patronage, and a New York Senator openly proclaimed ""that to the victors belong the spoils. . . . "" Jackson took a milder view. Decrying officeholders who seemed to enjoy life tenure, he believed Government duties could be ""so plain and simple"" that offices should rotate among deserving applicants. As national politics polarized around Jackson and his opposition, two parties grew out of the old Republican Party--the Democratic Republicans, or Democrats, adhering to Jackson; and the National Republicans, or Whigs, opposing him. Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and other Whig leaders proclaimed themselves defenders of popular liberties against the usurpation of Jackson. Hostile cartoonists portrayed him as King Andrew I. Behind their accusations lay the fact that Jackson, unlike previous Presidents, did not defer to Congress in policy-making but used his power of the veto and his party leadership to assume command. The greatest party battle centered around the Second Bank of the United States, a private corporation but virtually a Government-sponsored monopoly. When Jackson appeared hostile toward it, the Bank threw its power against him. Clay and Webster, who had acted as attorneys for the Bank, led the fight for its recharter in Congress. ""The bank,"" Jackson told Martin Van Buren, ""is trying to kill me, but I will kill it!"" Jackson, in vetoing the recharter bill, charged the Bank with undue economic privilege. His views won approval from the American electorate; in 1832 he polled more than 56 percent of the popular vote and almost five times as many electoral votes as Clay. Jackson met head-on the challenge of John C. Calhoun, leader of forces trying to rid themselves of a high protective tariff. When South Carolina undertook to nullify the tariff, Jackson ordered armed forces to Charleston and privately threatened to hang Calhoun. Violence seemed imminent until Clay negotiated a compromise: tariffs were lowered and South Carolina dropped nullification. In January of 1832, while the President was dining with friends at the White House, someone whispered to him that the Senate had rejected the nomination of Martin Van Buren as Minister to England. Jackson jumped to his feet and exclaimed, ""By the Eternal! I'll smash them!"" So he did. His favorite, Van Buren, became Vice President, and succeeded to the Presidency when ""Old Hickory"" retired to the Hermitage, where he died in June 1845.

Polk Often referred to as the first ""dark horse,"" James K. Polk was the 11th President of the United States from 1845 to 1849, the last strong President until the Civil War.  Often referred to as the first ""dark horse"" President, James K. Polk was the last of the Jacksonians to sit in the White House, and the last strong President until the Civil War. He was born in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, in 1795. Studious and industrious, Polk was graduated with honors in 1818 from the University of North Carolina. As a young lawyer he entered politics, served in the Tennessee legislature, and became a friend of Andrew Jackson. In the House of Representatives, Polk was a chief lieutenant of Jackson in his Bank war. He served as Speaker between 1835 and 1839, leaving to become Governor of Tennessee. Until circumstances raised Polk's ambitions, he was a leading contender for the Democratic nomination for Vice President in 1844. Both Martin Van Buren, who had been expected to win the Democratic nomination for President, and Henry Clay, who was to be the Whig nominee, tried to take the expansionist issue out of the campaign by declaring themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas. Polk, however, publicly asserted that Texas should be ""re-annexed"" and all of Oregon ""re-occupied."" The aged Jackson, correctly sensing that the people favored expansion, urged the choice of a candidate committed to the Nation's ""Manifest Destiny."" This view prevailed at the Democratic Convention, where Polk was nominated on the ninth ballot. ""Who is James K. Polk?"" Whigs jeered. Democrats replied Polk was the candidate who stood for expansion. He linked the Texas issue, popular in the South, with the Oregon question, attractive to the North. Polk also favored acquiring California. Even before he could take office, Congress passed a joint resolution offering annexation to Texas. In so doing they bequeathed Polk the possibility of war with Mexico, which soon severed diplomatic relations. In his stand on Oregon, the President seemed to be risking war with Great Britain also. The 1844 Democratic platform claimed the entire Oregon area, from the California boundary northward to a latitude of 54'40', the southern boundary of Russian Alaska. Extremists proclaimed ""Fifty-four forty or fight,"" but Polk, aware of diplomatic realities, knew that no course short of war was likely to get all of Oregon. Happily, neither he nor the British wanted a war. He offered to settle by extending the Canadian boundary, along the 49th parallel, from the Rockies to the Pacific. When the British minister declined, Polk reasserted the American claim to the entire area. Finally, the British settled for the 49th parallel, except for the southern tip of Vancouver Island. The treaty was signed in 1846. Acquisition of California proved far more difficult. Polk sent an envoy to offer Mexico up to $20,000,000, plus settlement of damage claims owed to Americans, in return for California and the New Mexico country. Since no Mexican leader could cede half his country and still stay in power, Polk's envoy was not received. To bring pressure, Polk sent Gen. Zachary Taylor to the disputed area on the Rio Grande. To Mexican troops this was aggression, and they attacked Taylor's forces. Congress declared war and, despite much Northern opposition, supported the military operations. American forces won repeated victories and occupied Mexico City. Finally, in 1848, Mexico ceded New Mexico and California in return for $15,000,000 and American assumption of the damage claims. President Polk added a vast area to the United States, but its acquisition precipitated a bitter quarrel between the North and the South over expansion of slavery. Polk, leaving office with his health undermined from hard work, died in June 1849.

The Trump Administration is committed to energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans and maximize the use of American resources, freeing us from dependence on foreign oil. For too long, we’ve been held back by burdensome regulations on our energy industry. President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years. Sound energy policy begins with the recognition that we have vast untapped domestic energy reserves right here in America. The Trump Administration will embrace the shale oil and gas revolution to bring jobs and prosperity to millions of Americans. We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own. We will use the revenues from energy production to rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure. Less expensive energy will be a big boost to American agriculture, as well. The Trump Administration is also committed to clean coal technology, and to reviving America’s coal industry, which has been hurting for too long. In addition to being good for our economy, boosting domestic energy production is in America’s national security interest. President Trump is committed to achieving energy independence from the OPEC cartel and any nations hostile to our interests. At the same time, we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy. Lastly, our need for energy must go hand-in-hand with responsible stewardship of the environment. Protecting clean air and clean water, conserving our natural habitats, and preserving our natural reserves and resources will remain a high priority. President Trump will refocus the EPA on its essential mission of protecting our air and water. A brighter future depends on energy policies that stimulate our economy, ensure our security, and protect our health. Under the Trump Administration’s energy policies, that future can become a reality.

She was the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she has become a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education. Download Low-res (209 KB) Download Hi-res (1207 KB) When people ask Michelle Obama to describe herself, she doesn't hesitate to say that first and foremost, she is Malia and Sasha's mom. But before she was a mother — or a wife, lawyer, or public servant — she was Fraser and Marian Robinson's daughter. The Robinsons lived in a brick bungalow on the South Side of Chicago. Fraser was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, and despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at a young age, he hardly ever missed a day of work. Marian stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother Craig, skillfully managing a busy household filled with love, laughter, and important life lessons. A product of Chicago public schools, Michelle Robinson studied sociology and African-American studies at Princeton University. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, she joined the Chicago law firm Sidley & Austin, where she later met Barack Obama, the man who would become the love of her life. After a few years, Mrs. Obama decided her true calling was working with people to serve their communities and their neighbors. She served as assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago's City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares youth for public service. In 1996, Mrs. Obama joined the University of Chicago with a vision of bringing campus and community together. As Associate Dean of Student Services, she developed the university's first community service program, and under her leadership as Vice President of Community and External Affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center, volunteerism skyrocketed. Mrs. Obama has continued her efforts to support and inspire young people during her time as First Lady. In 2010, she launched Let’s Move!, bringing together community leaders, educators, medical professionals, parents, and others in a nationwide effort to address the challenge of childhood obesity. Let’s Move! has an ambitious goal: to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation. Whether it's providing healthier food in our schools, helping kids be more physically active, or urging companies to market healthier foods to our children, Let’s Move! is focused on giving parents the support they need to make healthier choices for their kids. In 2011, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Jill Biden came together to launch Joining Forces, a nationwide initiative calling all Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities. Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sector to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives. In 2014, Mrs. Obama launched the Reach Higher Initiative, an effort to inspire young people across America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school, whether at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year college or university. Reach Higher aims to ensure that all students understand what they need to complete their education by working to expose students to college and career opportunities; helping them understand financial aid eligibility; encouraging academic planning and summer learning opportunities; and supporting high school counselors who do essential work to help students get into college. In 2015, Mrs. Obama joined President Obama to launch Let Girls Learn, a U.S. government-wide initiative to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school. As part of this effort, Mrs. Obama is calling on countries across the globe to help educate and empower young women, and she is sharing the stories and struggles of these young women with young people here at home to inspire them to commit to their own education.   As First Lady, Mrs. Obama worked on the issues close to her heart — supporting military families, helping children lead healthier lives, and encouraging all our young people to fulfill their boundless promise.   Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Email Twitter Instagram Facebook Contact Us Home Briefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest News Video Gallery From the Press OfficeSpeeches & Remarks Press Briefings Statements & Releases Presidential Actions Legislation Nominations & Appointments Disclosures IssuesTop IssuesAmerica First Energy Plan America First Foreign Policy Bringing Back Jobs And Growth Making Our Military Strong Again Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community Trade Deals That Work For All Americans The AdministrationThe AdministrationPresident Donald J.
